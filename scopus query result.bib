abstract = {Context-aware Recommender Systems (CARS) deal with modeling and prediction of user interests and preferences according to contextual information while generating a recommendation. In contextual modeling-based CARS, the context information is used straight into the recommendation function as a predictor explicitly. Thus, this approach formulates a multidimensional recommendation model and is best realized through Tensor Factorization (TF) based techniques. It efficiently handles the data sparsity problem faced by most of the traditional RS. However, the recent TF-based CARS face issues such as differentiating amongst relevant and irrelevant context variables, biased recommendations, and long-tail problem. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based approach for determining the list of most relevant and optimum contexts for two datasets, namely the LDos Comoda and Travel dataset. The mutual trust model that combines user level and item level trust is proposed further which utilizes the concept of trust propagation to calculate the inferred trust between users/items. Finally, a hybrid reranking technique combining the item popularity and item absolute likeability reranking approaches with the standard ranking technique of generating recommendations is proposed to generate diversified recommendations. Comparative experiments on the LDos Comoda and the Travel datasets are conducted and the experimental results show an improvement of the proposed work with respect to RMSE of 50%, 55%, and 59% compared to MF-based RS, trust-based RS, and context-aware RS respectively. Also, the proposed reranking technique shows approximately three times more diversified recommendations than the standard ranking approach without a significant loss in precision.},

abstract = {Safety is one concern that hinders the acceptance of ridesharing in the general public. Several studies have been conducted on the trust issue in recent years to relieve this concern. The introduction of trust in ridesharing systems provides a pragmatic approach to solving this problem. In this study, we will develop a trust-aware ridesharing recommender system decision model to generate recommendations for drivers and passengers. The requirements of trust for both sides, drivers and passengers, are taken into consideration in the decision model proposed in this paper. The decision model considers the factors in typical ridesharing systems, including vehicle capacities, timing, location and trust requirements, etc. The decision model aims to determine the shared rides that minimize cost while respecting the trust and relevant constraints. As the decision problem is a nonlinear integer programming problem, we combine a self-adaptive neighborhood search with Differential Evolution to develop an algorithm to solve it. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, several other evolutionary computation approaches are also applied to solve the same problem. The effectiveness assessment is done based on the performance of applying different algorithms to find solutions for test cases, to provide a guideline for selecting a proper solution approach.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have been extensively employed in many applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. They have attracted a lot of attention in designing recommender systems due to their recent significant achievements. These models are mainly used in recommender systems to generate the users' latent features according to the input data such as user-item rating and trust matrixes. However, such input data are significantly sparse leading to reduce the effectiveness of deep learning models in generating the latent features. In addition, the existing deep learning based recommendation models ignore the reliability measure in their recommendation process. To address these challenges, in this paper, a trust-aware recommendation method based on deep sparse autoencoder is proposed. Specifically, an effective probabilistic model is proposed to determine how many ratings are required for each user to produce an accurate prediction. Moreover, for enhancing the rating profiles of users with insufficient ratings, an efficient mechanism is developed based on the utilization of implicit ratings. In this mechanism, the implicit ratings are selected based on a reliability measure to guarantee their effectiveness. Then, the reliable enhanced rating profiles and trust statements are considered as the input data of deep sparse autoencoder to generate the users' latent features. Finally, a similarity function that utilizes the generated latent features is developed to obtain similarity values between users and make recommendations. Massive experiments are carried out on two datasets to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the-state-of-the-art models. The results of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly beat other models in producing more accurate recommendations.},

abstract = {In the age of the digital revolution and the widespread usage of social networks, the modalities of information consumption and production were disrupted by the shift to instantaneous transmission. Sometimes the scoop and exclusivity are just for a few minutes. Information spreads like wildfire throughout the world, with little regard for context or critical thought, resulting in the proliferation of fake news. As a result, it is preferable to have a system that allows consumers to obtain balanced news information. Some researchers attempted to detect false and authentic news using tagged data and had some success. Online social groups propagate digital false news or fake news material in the form of shares, reshares, and repostings. This work aims to detect fake news forms dispatched on social networks to enhance the quality of trust and transparency in the social network recommendation system. It provides an overview of traditional techniques used to detect fake news and modern approaches used for multiclassification using unlabeled data. Many researchers are focusing on detecting fake news, but fewer works highlight this detection's role in improving the quality of trust in social network recommendation systems. In this research paper, we take an improved approach to assisting users in deciding which information to read by alerting them about the degree of inaccuracy of the news items they are seeing and recommending the many types of fake news that the material represents.},

abstract = {Traditional recommender systems have always suffered from cold start and data sparsity problems by leveraging only a rating matrix. Social recommender systems try to address such problems by leveraging the user's social information, such as trust relationships, as auxiliary information. However, such explicit social information is not always available. In this paper, an implicit interest relationship mining approach based on network representation learning for recommendation, called INRec, is proposed to deeply mine implicit social information and fuse both explicit and implicit social information into a matrix factorization (MF) model and thus improve the effectiveness of the recommendations is proposed. Specifically, a modified one-mode projection method is first designed to construct an interest-connected user interaction network, and a network representation learning method is then employed to generate low-dimensional user representations. Abundant user interest relationships can be later obtained from user representations through a similarity calculation. Finally, a multi-source information fusion approach is applied to incorporate explicit and implicit social relationships into the MF model. The experimental results demonstrated that the average MAE and RMSE by INRec achieves 0.7415 and 0.9633 on three datasets (FilmTrust, CiaoDVD, Epinions), and it remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.},

abstract = {Most existing studies that employ social-trust information to solve the data sparsity issue in recommender systems assume that socially connected users have equal influence on each other. However, this assumption does not hold in practice since users and their friends may not have similar interests because social connections are multifaceted and exhibit heterogeneous strengths in different scenarios. Therefore, estimating the diverse levels of influence among entities (users/items/social connections) is very important in advancing social recommender systems. Towards this goal, we propose a new model named Social-Trust-Aware Variational Recommendation (SOAP-VAE). Particularly, SOAP-VAE leverages graph attention network techniques to capture the varying levels of influence and the complex interaction patterns among all the entities collectively and holistically. In doing so, heterogeneity among entities is obtained seamlessly. Consequently, we generate social-trust-aware item embedding representations in which the right level of influence has been integrated. Next, based on these rich social-trust-aware item representations, we formulate the first-ever social-trust-aware prior in literature. Unlike priors utilized in earlier VAE-based recommendation models, this novel prior aids in dealing with the issue of posterior-collapse and can effectively capture the uncertainty of latent space. In effect, the model produces better latent representations, which significantly alleviates the data sparsity issue. Finally, we empirically show that SOAP-VAE outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world data sets.},

abstract = {A context-aware recommender system (CARS) utilizes users' context to provide personalized services. Contextual information can be derived from sensors in order to improve the accuracy of the recommendations. In this work, we focus on CARSs with high-dimensional contextual information that typically impacts the recommendation model, for example, by increasing the model's dimensionality and sparsity. Generating accurate recommendations is not enough to constitute a useful system from the user's perspective, since the use of some contextual information may cause problems, such as draining the user's battery, raising privacy concerns, and more. Previous studies suggested reducing the amount of contextual information utilized by using domain knowledge to select the most suitable information. This approach is only applicable when the set of contexts is small enough to handle and sufficient for preventing sparsity. Moreover, hand-crafted context information may not represent an optimal set of features for the recommendation process. Another approach is to compress the contextual information into a denser latent space, but this may limit the ability to explain the recommended items to the users or compromise their trust. In this paper, we present a multi-step approach for selecting low-dimensional subsets of contextual information and incorporating them explicitly within CARSs. At the core of our approach is a novel feature selection algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction CARS algorithms by improving recommendation accuracy and interpretability. Over the course of evolution, thousands of diverse feature subsets are generated; a deep context-aware model is produced for each feature subset, and the subsets are stacked together. The resulting stacked model is accurate and only uses interpretable, explicit features. Our approach includes a mechanism of tuning the different underlying algorithms that affect user concerns, such as privacy and battery consumption. We evaluated our approach on two high-dimensional context-aware datasets derived from smartphones. An empirical analysis of our results confirms that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art CARS models while improving transparency and interpretability for the user. In addition to the empirical results, we present several use cases, examples and methodology of how researchers, domain experts and CARS modelers can tweak the feature selection algorithm to improve various user concerns and interpretability.},

In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based representation learning method, namely multi-perspective social recommendation (MPSR), to construct hierarchical user preferences and assign friends' influences with different levels of trust from varying perspectives. We further utilize the attributes of items to partition and excavate users' explicit preferences and employ complementary perspective modeling to learn implicit preferences of users. To measure the trust degree of friends from different perspectives, the statistical information of users' historical behavior is utilized to construct multi-perspective social networks. Experimental results on two public datasets of Yelp and Ciao demonstrate that the MPSR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Further detailed analysis verifies the importance of mining explicit characteristics of users and the necessity for diverse social relationships, which show the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

abstract = {Smart services are a concept that provides services to the citizens in an efficient manner. The online shopping and recommender system can play an important role for smart cities in providing relevant item recommendations to the users. One of the famous Recommendation System strategies is known as Collaborative Filtering and provides popular suggestions to the users. The recommendation is generated by identifying a set of similar users from a user-item rating matrix using a similarity measure. The problem with the majority of the recommender systems is whether the generated recommendations are good enough because users usually find recommendations from their circle more appealing. It is important to use only those similar users that have some kind of trust among them. The accuracy of the recommendations also gets affected due to the sparsity of the user-item matrix. To handle these problems, a trust-based technique TrustASVD++ is proposed, which combines a user's trust data in the Matrix Factorization context. The proposed method combines trust values with user ratings for improved recommendations using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). PCC is compared with other state-of-the-art similarity measures, and the results obtained show that PCC outperforms all the other relevant measures. To assess the efficiency of the offered strategy, testing on numerous datasets has been carried out including Epinions, FilmTrust, and Ciao. The results illustrate the considerable improvement of the proposed method over numerous contemporary techniques.},

Next, we adopt improved structural hole (ISH) algorithm by integrating the topological structure of social trust network with learners' interactive information and identify the most influential learners cluster by the ISH algorithm. For the final stage, we predict the score of target learners based on explicit and implicit feedback information and realize the personalized learning recommendation for new learners. Since the score is predicted, we compare MAE and RMSE in two real-world datasets which are Canvas Network and Wanke website, respectively.

Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719–731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920–1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions. There are still many scenarios to explore how to make XAI effective in clinical settings due to the complexity of medical knowledge.},

abstract = {Cognitive inspired recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention in recent years, aiming at fitting user ratings on certain items. However, the performance of recommendation approaches has been limited due to the sparsity and ambiguity of cognitive knowledge user-item ratings. Top-k recommendation has therefore been addressed and has become one of the most popular research areas. The goal of top-k recommendation is to capture the relative preferences of users and fit the optimal ranking list of items. Meanwhile, the development of social networks provides a new way to model user preferences to improve the accuracy and interpretation ability of cognition-aware recommendation models. To integrate user social information into top-k recommendation, we propose a group-enhanced ranking method based on matrix factorization. In our method, we first compute trust values between users based on user trust relationships. Then, we incorporate a trust matrix into the loss function with a social-based penalty term that reduces the distances between preference vectors of trusted users. Experimental results on two real datasets from Epinions and BaiduMovies show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) value. Our model effectively improves the accuracy of social recommendations. We propose a novel cognitive knowledge-aware group-enhanced social recommendation method for item recommendation. The model modifies the loss function by considering the user trust relationship and group-enhanced ranking and significantly improves the performance of social recommendations.},

abstract = {Most recommendation systems focus on predicting rating or finding aspect information in reviews to understand user preferences and item properties. However, these methods ignore the effectiveness and persuasiveness of recommendation results. Consequently, explainable recommendation, namely providing recommendation results with recommendation reasons at the same time, has attracted increasing attention of researchers due to its ability in fostering transparency and trust. It is lucky that some E-commerce websites provide a kind of new interaction box called Tips and users can express their comments on items with a simple sentence. This brings us an opportunity to realize explainable recommendation. Under the supervision of two explicit feedback, namely rating and textual tips, we can implement a multi-task learning model which can provide recommendation results and generate recommendation reasons at the same time. In this paper, we propose an Encoder-Decoder and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) based Explainable Recommendation model named EMER to simultaneously implement reason generation and rating prediction. Items title contains significant product-related information and plays an important role in grabbing users attention, so we fuse it in our model to generate recommendation reasons. Numerous experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art models.},

Recommender Systems (RS) are a well-known solution to this issue. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely accepted and popular technique to implement an RS. However, cold-start and data sparsity problems reduce the performance of CF methods. One promising solution for these issues is to use the social trust information. However, how to properly use social trust information is a hot and still open question. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure and a simple link prediction method to address this question and employ them in trust-aware matrix factorization. Especially, our proposed similarity measure is asymmetric to consider the nature of social relationships. Also, to have a more accurate similarity estimation, we have considered both the user's historical ratings and trust relations, and we have determined the weight of each source. Finally, we have used the item-based model and the level of interest a user's trustee has for an item to improve the performance of the proposed method for sparse datasets. We conduct extensive performance evaluations in terms of rate prediction and interesting items found. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in terms of Mean Absolute Error.},

Building historical trust-based models of raters, our method is implemented as an external module and integrated with the collaborative filter through a post-recommendation component. The inter-user trust profiling history, traceability and authenticity are ensured by blockchain, since these profiles are stored as a smart contract in a private Ethereum network.

abstract = {Trustworthy recommendation of a movie is a highly complex task for the entertainment industry wherein trust is s a crucial metric of recommendation systems. It depends upon various factors, such as preferences, reviews, emotions, promotions and sentiments. However, these factors are specific to individuals and may vary from person to person. Additionally, the data collected for movie recommendations suffer from data sparsity and cold start problems. Previous studies on movie recommendations have failed to be trustworthy because their performance is greatly affected by fake ratings, data sparsity, and cold start problems. Also, the existing models of Recommender Systems (RS) do not consider the trust score and the user's rating criterion. Keeping this in view, in this paper, the rating and ranking criteria with a trust score of different users is incorporated into the proposed machine learning-based RS models to ensure the trustworthiness of the system. In particular, one can notice that the most relevant viewers have the same taste and preferences. So, the bipartite relationship between the movie and the viewer has been interpreted through the inversion similarity concept which is used to design an efficient and trustworthy movie recommendation model for a community of viewers. The proposed model uses a learning algorithm to measure the trust score of recommendations and also performs cluster analysis to identify the groups having similar behavior in their communities. The information extracted from the cluster analysis identifies the user's pattern of movie watching and predicts their movie selection behavior. We have performed extensive experiments to find and compare the performance of the proposed models with other existing models. The results of the experiments demonstrated the better performance of proposed models and supported the claim.},

abstract = {This work aims to implement a clustering scheme to separate vehicles into a cluster that is based on various parameters, such as the total number of relay nodes, mistrust value, experience-based trust, and recommendation based trust. The Fuzzy based trust recommendation policy (FBTRP) creates a trust model that enables a recommendation and trust-based communication between the relay nodes. The FBTRP policy computes the trust value of each relay/intermediate node using two parameters namely network density and distance factor of the relay. Based on this trust value obtained from the FBTRP policy, the secure relay nodes can be selected to forward the data packets from the source to the destination. The proposed trust-based mechanism uses a Deep Belief Network (DBN) to predict the vehicle's malicious behaviour in the future using the threshold value obtained and divide the vehicles into three lists namely Green (Normal), Ash (Abnormal), and Black (Malicious). This trust results derived from the FBTRP-DBN model helps to select an optimal cluster head using the highest trustworthy node present in the VANET network by eliminating the malicious ones. The main aim of this work is to prevent malicious attacks from the trusted node and prevent the VANET network from DoS attacks. The efficiency of the proposed FBTRP-DBN trust model is evaluated by comparing it with different state-of-art techniques using various performance evaluation metrics such as False Positive Rate, Detection Rate, Processing Delay, Network Accuracy, PDR, Throughput Ratio, End to End delay, Communication Overhead, and False Alarm Detection Rate.},

abstract = {The recommendation system has become the primary tool used by many Internet application platforms to solve the problem of information overload, and it faces issues such as data sparsity, cold start, and scalability. At present, most social recommendation algorithms only consider the influence of the trust relationship on the user's feature vector, which indirectly affects the predicted rating, or consider directly trusting friends as neighbor users, which directly affects the predicted rating, but does not consider the direct influence and indirect combining influences to make rating predictions. Therefore, this paper proposes a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm (ETBRec), which not only considers the trust difference between users but also proposes the definition of experts and considers the direct impact of expert users on prediction ratings and the trustees' indirect impact of ratings. Among them, the trust difference is realized through trust metrics, including direct trust metrics and indirect trust metrics; the selection of expert users takes into account the user's degree of trust and user rating attitude; experimental comparisons with various social recommendation algorithms and related recommendation algorithms on the Ciao and Douban datasets. The experimental results show that the ETBRec algorithm performs better on some evaluation indexes such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).},

Aiming at addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a deep learning-based initialization recommendation method for trust-aware recommendation, named DLIR. In DLIR framework, we first leverage deep learning to learn a better latent feature vector of users and items and then take it as the initial value of the latent factor model (LFM) recommendations. Next, the users' trust information and items' information are employed to construct users' social trust ensemble and the items' intrinsic feature relationship, respectively. Finally, the constructed information is integrated into LFM for trust-aware recommendation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed DLIR, the extensive experiments conducted on two real datasets (e.g., Epinions and Last.fm) show that the proposed approach performs much better than state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms on recommendation accuracy.},

abstract = {In social networks, trust is a fundamental notion affecting the nature and the strength of ties between individuals. It is also a piece of useful auxiliary information for improving the performance of recommendation systems. The number of ratings given by a user is minimal compared to all items in popular, widely-used e-commerce sites. Therefore, the user-item matrix that is used in collaborative filtering suffers from data sparsity, resulting in poor recommendation quality. Another issue is the cold start problem, which occurs for the inclusion of new users and new items to the system. Trust notion is helpful for alleviating the effect of these problems by providing additional relationships between the users and pointing out strong relationships. Information as to the trust between users can be explicitly available. However, such information is not widely available, and hence implicit trust models have been employed. This work analyzes two sub-problems under trust modeling for recommendation: (1) What is the relationship between explicit and implicit trust scores, are they replaceable? (2) Can we model explicit trust in a trust network? For the first problem, we present an implicit trust model and analyze the compatibility of implicit and explicit trust scores. For the second problem, we model explicit trust modeling as a link prediction problem and analyze the performance of the prediction models we generate on a set of benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {We propose “Deep Autoencoders for Feature Learning in Recommender Systems,” a novel discriminative model based on the incorporation of features from autoencoders in combination with embeddings into a deep neural network to predict ratings in recommender systems. The work has two major motivations. The first is to engineer features for recommender systems in a domain-agnostic way using autoencoders. The second is to develop a method that sets a benchmark for predictive accuracy. In our proposed solution, we build a user autoencoder and item autoencoder that extract latent features for the users and items, respectively. The additional features engineered are the latent features for the users and items, and these come from the bottleneck activations of the autoencoder. Our method of feature engineering is domain agnostic, as the inner-most activations would differ for domains without any additional effort required on part of the modeler. Next, we then use the activations of the inner-most layers of the autoencoders as features in a subsequent deep neural network to predict the ratings along-with user and item embeddings. Our method incorporates additional linear and nonlinear latent features from the autoencoders to improve predictive accuracy. This is different from the existing approaches that use autoencoders as full-fledged recommender systems or use autoencoders to generate features for a subsequent supervised learning algorithm or without using embeddings. We demonstrate the out performance of our solution on four different datasets of varying sizes and sparsity, namely MovieLens 100 K, MovieLens 1 M, FilmTrust and BookCrossing datasets, with strong experimental results. We have compared our DAFERec method against mDA-CF, TrustSVD, SVD variants, BiasedMF, ItemKNN and I-AutoRec methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed solution beats the benchmarks and is a highly flexible model that works on different datasets solving different business problems like book recommendations, movie recommendations and trust.},

Their interactive and engaging nature makes conversational recommenders a natural platform to not only provide recommendations but also justify the recommendations through explanations. The recent surge of interest inexplainable AI enables diverse styles of justification, and also invites questions on how styles of justification impact user perception. In this article, we explore the effect of "why"justifications and "why not"justifications on users' perceptions of explainability and trust. We developed and tested a movie-recommendation chatbot that provides users with different types of justifications for the recommended items. Our online experiment (n = 310) demonstrates that the "why"justifications (but not the "why not"justifications) have a significant impact on users' perception of the conversational recommender. Particularly, "why"justifications increase users' perception of system transparency, which impacts perceived control, trusting beliefs and in turn influences users' willingness to depend on the system's advice. Finally, we discuss the design implications for decision-assisting chatbots.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of Internet, e-commerce websites and social networks, people prefer to receive recommendations from their social friends rather than strangers. Also, the exponential evolution and use of online social networks has resulted in generation of enormous amount of information over web. The relationships between users in social networks are complex, vague and uncertain for computation. Adhering to the intuition that a user's social network plays a prominent role in influencing the personal behavior of users on web, this paper proposes a trust and semantic-based social recommendation approach to remove cold-start issues. Social relationships are used to compute trust between users in the social networks. Trusted relations are used in addition to rating matrix to extract the implicit data. For each user, we also attempt to discover the top-k semantic friends because a user is connected to multiple friends on social networks who have different tastes. This proposed approach is superior to those traditional approaches that give equal weights to all users in social networks. One important advantage of this approach is consideration of social friends at different levels. Experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms some of the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.},

abstract = {The recommender system (RS), as a computer-supported information filtering system, is ubiquitous and influences what we eat, watch, or even like. In online RS, interactions between users and the system form a feedback loop: users take actions based on the recommendations provided by RS, and RS updates its recommendations accordingly. As such interactions increase, the issue of recommendation homogeneity intensifies, which significantly impairs user experience. In the face of this long-standing issue, the newly-emerging social e-commerce offers a new solution - bringing friends' recommendations into the loop (friend-in-the-loop). In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on the benefits of friend-in-the-loop through mixed methods on a leading social e-commerce platform in China, Beidian. We reveal that friend-in-the-loop provides users with more accurate and diverse recommendations than merely RS, and significantly alleviates algorithmic homogeneity. Moreover, our qualitative results demonstrate that the introduction of friends' external knowledge, consumers' trust, and empathy accounts for these benefits. Overall, we elaborate that friend-in-the-loop comprehensively benefits both users and RS, and it is a promising HCI-based solution to recommendation homogeneity, which offers insightful implications on designing future human-algorithm collaboration models.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely adopted by many firms across various industries over the past decade, as they could provide numerous economic benefits to the industry, such as influencing consumer choices, generating the lift in sales, and enhancing consumer trust. Many currently-deployed recommender systems primiarily optimize the similarity measure following the Collaborative Filtering paradigm during the recommendation performance, which focuses on the matching between targeted users and items of their interests. Although effective and useful in many cases, these still face several important challenges to fully address consumers' concerns. In particular, they usually provide recommendations of the most similar items related to the consumption records, without taking into account the multi-faceted consumer preferences. For example, some consumers would be satisfied to receive recommendations that are novel and unexpected to broaden their horizons, while others might be interested to receive recommendations from other product categories to expand their interests. Falling to do so would lead to the filter bubble and exploration-exploitation trade-off phenomenon, which is undesirable because it would significantly reduce sales diversity and deteriorate user satisfaction with recommender systems. In my thesis proposal, I will describe new methods to design recommender systems following two research streams to tackle the aforementioned challenges, namely unexpected recommender system and cross-domain system. In particular, unexpected recommender systems address consumers' desire for variety, and aim at providing novel and useful recommendations simultaneously, while cross-domain recommender systems learn consumer preferences from their behaviors in other domains to better predict their behaviors in the target domain. The proposed models are capable of significantly improving recommendation performance and user satisfaction, as demonstrated through extensive offline and online experiments discussed in this proposal.},

abstract = {In the recommender systems literature, it has been shown that, in addition to improving system effectiveness, explaining recommendations may increase user satisfaction, trust, persuasion and loyalty. In general, explanations focus on the filtering algorithms or the users and items involved in the generation of recommendations. However, on certain domains that are rich on user-generated textual content, it would be valuable to provide justifications of recommendations according to arguments that are explicit, underlying or related with the data used by the systems, e.g., the reasons for customers' opinions in reviews of e-commerce sites, and the requests and claims in citizens' proposals and debates of e-participation platforms. In this context, there is a need and challenging task to automatically extract and exploit the arguments given for and against evaluated items. We thus advocate to focus not only on user preferences and item features, but also on associated arguments. In other words, we propose to not only consider what is said about items, but also why it is said. Hence, arguments would not only be part of the recommendation explanations, but could also be used by the recommendation algorithms themselves. To this end, in this thesis, we propose to use argument mining techniques and tools that allow retrieving and relating argumentative information from textual content, and investigate recommendation methods that exploit that information before, during and after their filtering processes.},

Moreover, our system is model-agnostic (for both recommender systems and critiquing models) allowing a great flexibility and further extensions.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation's turn. We address these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the generalization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference and the critique separately. Our work's most important innovation is our critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.},

abstract = {Recommender systems trained via long-horizon optimization (e.g., reinforcement learning) will have incentives to actively manipulate user preferences through the recommended content. While some work has argued for making systems myopic to avoid this issue, even such systems can induce systematic undesirable preference shifts. Thus, rather than artificially stifling the capabilities of the system, in this work we explore how we can make capable systems that explicitly avoid undesirable shifts. We advocate for (1) estimating the preference shifts that would be induced by recommender system policies, and (2) explicitly characterizing what unwanted shifts are and assessing before deployment whether such policies will produce them-ideally even actively optimizing to avoid them. These steps involve two challenging ingredients: (1) requires the ability to anticipate how hypothetical policies would influence user preferences if deployed; instead, (2) requires metrics to assess whether such influences are manipulative or otherwise unwanted. We study how to do (1) from historical user interaction data by building a user predictive model that implicitly contains their preference dynamics; to address (2), we introduce the notion of a "safe policy", which defines a trust region within which behavior is believed to be safe. We show that recommender systems that optimize for staying in the trust region avoid manipulative behaviors (e.g., changing preferences in ways that make users more predictable), while still generating engagement.},

abstract = {The actions of intelligent agents, such as chatbots, recommender systems, and virtual assistants are typically not fully transparent to the user. Consequently, users take the risk that such agents act in ways opposed to the users' preferences or goals. It is often argued that people use trust as a cognitive shortcut to reduce the complexity of such interactions. Here we formalise this by using the methods of evolutionary game theory to study the viability of trust-based strategies in repeated games. These are reciprocal strategies that cooperate as long as the other player is observed to be cooperating. Unlike classic reciprocal strategies, once mutual cooperation has been observed for a threshold number of rounds they stop checking their co-player's behaviour every round, and instead only check it with some probability. By doing so, they reduce the opportunity cost of verifying whether the action of their co-player was actually cooperative. We demonstrate that these trust-based strategies can outcompete strategies that are always conditional, such as Tit-for-Tat, when the opportunity cost is non-negligible. We argue that this cost is likely to be greater when the interaction is between people and intelligent agents, because of the reduced transparency of the agent. Consequently, we expect people to use trust-based strategies more frequently in interactions with intelligent agents. Our results provide new, important insights into the design of mechanisms for facilitating interactions between humans and intelligent agents, where trust is an essential factor.},

To address the aforementioned problems, we present an I mplicit T rust R elation-A ware model (ITRA) based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). ITRA adopts an attention module to feed the weighted trust embedding information into an inherited non-linear VAE structure. In this sense, ITRA could provide recommendations by reconstructing a non-binary adjacency social matrix with implicit high-order interactions from both indirect key opinion leaders and explicit connections from neighbors. The extensive experiments conducted on three datasets illustrate that ITRA could achieve a better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Our approach is proven as a feasible one, since it reached the prediction accuracy of 89%, with a confidence of approximately 0.89, when applied to an online dataset of a social network. Naive Bayes algorithms, in general, are widely used on recommender systems because they are fast and easy to implement. However, the requirement for predictors to be independent remains a challenge due to the fact that in real-life scenarios, the predictors are usually dependent.

Meanwhile, we face some challenges such as calculating the level of trust between users, the movement of Trust Walker using Random walk (random route selection), not discovering the desired rank, and as a result, the algorithm failure. In the present study, in order to solve the mentioned challenges, a trust-based recommender system is presented that predicts the ranks of items that the target user has not rated. In the first stage, a trusted network is developed based on the three criteria. In the next step, we define a Trust Walker to calculate the level of trust between users, and we apply the Biased Random Walk (BRW) algorithm to move it; the proposed method recommends it to the target user in the case of finding the desired rank of the item, and if that item does not exist in the defined trust network, it uses association rules to recognize items that are dependent on the item being searched and recommends them to the target user.

abstract = {Trust in a recommendation system (RS) is often algorithmically incorporated using implicit or explicit feedback of user-perceived trustworthy social neighbors, and evaluated using user-reported trustworthiness of recommended items. However, real-life recommendation settings can feature group disparities in trust, power, and prerogatives. Our study examines a complementary view of trust which relies on the editorial power relationships and attitudes of all stakeholders in the RS application domain. We devise a simple, first-principles metric of editorial authority, i.e., user preferences for recommendation sourcing, veto power, and incorporating user feedback, such that one RS user group confers trust upon another by ceding or assigning editorial authority. In a mixed-methods study at Virginia Tech, we surveyed faculty, teaching assistants, and students about their preferences of editorial authority, and hypothesis-tested its relationship with trust in algorithms for a hypothetical ĝSuggested Readings' RS. We discover that higher RS editorial authority assigned to students is linked to the relative trust the course staff allocates to RS algorithm and students. We also observe that course staff favors higher control for the RS algorithm in sourcing and updating the recommendations long-term. Using content analysis, we discuss frequent staff-recommended student editorial roles and highlight their frequent rationales, such as perceived expertise, scaling the learning environment, professional curriculum needs, and learner disengagement. We argue that our analyses highlight critical user preferences to help detect editorial power asymmetry and identify RS use-cases for supporting teaching and research.},

Probabilistic matrix factorization is a classic algorithm for recommender systems. However, both the rating matrix and trust matrix become sparser, which makes the recommended results inaccurate. We propose a hybrid method based on probabilistic matrix factorization and directed trust. First, we apply the probabilistic matrix factorization approach to break down the trust matrix. Thus, the potential preferences of users, considering trusters and trustees, are obtained. This approach alleviates the problem of the sparsity of the trust matrix. Second, to capture the trust relations among users, we modify undirected trust to directed trust, since a user has different preferences when he is treated as a truster or trustee. Last, the two algorithms are combined to predict ratings. Experiments involving two datasets show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing benchmark algorithms.},

abstract = {Over the years, cross-domain and trust-based recommendation systems are proven to be very helpful in solving issues pertaining to data sparsity and cold start. Many e-commerce sites used recommender systems as business tools for increasing their sale productivity and help their customers in finding suitable products. However, due to sparse rating and lack of historical information, such systems cannot generate effective recommendations. Matrix factorization and deep learning techniques have been the focus of research community for the last few years to solve the problem of data sparsity and cold start. In this paper, we have proposed a model called Trust Aware Cross-Domain Deep Neural Matrix Factorization (TCrossDNMF) that predicts rating of an item for an active user and solves user cold start problem in the cross-domain scenario of ‘User Overlap' in e-commerce system. TCrossDNMF model is divided into four main steps: i) Features learning that learns the users' features using a latent factor model and then finds the similarity between users of source and target domains. As the users are shared between two domains, the proposed model learns the common information and transfers the knowledge from a source to target domain. ii) Ranking that finds set of similar users (neighbors), and then filters out the dissimilar users based on similarity threshold $\theta$, and then generates a bipartite trust graph from these reduced set of users and executes Ant Colony Optimization, to find trustworthy neighbors for an active user. iii) Weighting computes the trust degree between an active user and his or her top-k neighbors. iv) Prediction that trains the TCrossDNMF model using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and generalized matrix factorization (GMF) by representing user-item interactions in higher dimensions and ensembles the GMF and MLP with trust information for rating prediction. We evaluated proposed model on a real dataset collected from a popular e-commerce retail service ‘AliExpress'. We used categories available in ‘AliExpress' as source domain and a target domain. For observing the performance of proposed model, we took six domains that have a higher ratio of sparsity. The proposed model is evaluated by using MAE, RMSE and F-measure metrics and compared it with baselines. The experiments show that the proposed model is a viable solution for the mentioned problem with significant improvements in results.},

In this work, we argue that, by facilitating reproducibility of recommender systems experimentation, we indirectly address the issues of accountability and transparency in recommender systems research from the perspectives of practitioners, designers, and engineers aiming to assess the capabilities of published research works. These issues have become increasingly prevalent in recent literature. Reasons for this include societal movements around intelligent systems and artificial intelligence striving toward fair and objective use of human behavioral data (as in Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, or Human–Computer Interaction). Society has grown to expect explanations and transparency standards regarding the underlying algorithms making automated decisions for and around us. This work surveys existing definitions of these concepts and proposes a coherent terminology for recommender systems research, with the goal to connect reproducibility to accountability. We achieve this by introducing several guidelines and steps that lead to reproducible and, hence, accountable experimental workflows and research. We additionally analyze several instantiations of recommender system implementations available in the literature and discuss the extent to which they fit in the introduced framework. With this work, we aim to shed light on this important problem and facilitate progress in the field by increasing the accountability of research.},

They are considered information filtering systems that make predictions or recommendations to users based on their interests and preferences. The more recent technology, Linked Open Data (LOD), has been introduced, and a vast amount of Resource Description Framework data have been published in freely accessible datasets. These datasets are connected to form the so-called LOD cloud. The need for semantic data representation has been identified as one of the next challenges in Recommender Systems. In a LOD-enabled recommendation framework where domain awareness plays a key role, the semantic information provided in the LOD can be exploited. However, dealing with a big chunk of the data from the LOD cloud and its integration with any domain datasets remains a challenge due to various issues, such as resource constraints and broken links. This paper presents the challenges of interconnecting and extracting the DBpedia data with the MovieLens 1 Million dataset. This study demonstrates how LOD can be a vital yet rich source of content knowledge that helps recommender systems address the issues of data sparsity and insufficient content analysis. Based on the challenges, we proposed a few alternatives and solutions to some of the challenges.},

abstract = {The convergence of AI and IoT enables data to be quickly explored and turned into vital decisions, and however, there are still some challenging issues to be further addressed. For example, lacking of enough data in AI-based decision making [so-called sparse decision making (SDM)] will decrease the efficiency dramatically, or even disable the intelligent IoT networks. Taking the intelligent IoT networks as the network infrastructure, the recommendation systems have been facing such SDM problems. A naive solution is to introduce trust information. However, trust information may also face the difficulty of sparse trust evidence (also known as sparse trust problem). In our work, an accurate SDM model with two-way trust recommendation in the AI-enabled IoT systems is proposed, named TT-SVD. Our model incorporates both trust information and rating information more thoroughly, which can efficiently alleviate the above-mentioned sparse trust problem and therefore be able to solve the cold start and data sparsity problems. Specifically, we first consider the twofold trust influences from both trustees and trusters, which can be represented by a factor named trust propensity. To this end, we propose a dual model, including a truster model (TrusterSVD) and a trustee model (TrusteeSVD) based on an existing rating-only recommendation model called SVD++, which are integrated by the weighted average and yield the final model, TT-SVD. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art, including SVD and TrustSVD in both the 'all users' and 'cold start users' cases, and the accuracy improvement can reach a maximum of 29%. Complexity analysis shows that our model is equally suitable for the case of large sparse data sets. In summary, our model can effectively solve the sparse decision problem by introducing the two-way trust recommendation, and hence improve the efficiency of the intelligent recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Drug discovery is notorious for its low success rates [5]. Despite best research efforts, the majority of drugs fail at early stages of development, even before they enter clinical trials. This phenomenon stems from the inherent complexity of biological systems and our poor understanding of human diseases. To improve that understanding, swaths of data have been generated in recent years. Still, data does not easily translate into knowledge or actionable insights. Here we explore how approaches from the recommendation system domain could help scientists comprehend the ever-growing amount of biomedical facts. The aim of these efforts is to make better drug development decisions, which ultimately result in safe and efficient treatments for patients [3]. Recommendation systems are well established in e-commerce, streaming and social media platforms, however in the biomedical domain their usage is limited to a few recent studies [1, 6, 7, 8]. Direct transfer of classic recommendation approaches to the biomedical domain is not trivial. Specifics of the problem space impose numerous challenges for a recommendation system practitioner, to name a few: Regardless of the challenges, the adoption of recommendation systems presents numerous opportunities to support and accelerate drug discovery. Even a slight increase in success rate of drug pipelines will result in a vast number of patients gaining access to safe and effective treatments. Recommendation systems could play a leading role in this process. Adding context to experimental data is one class of problems that could benefit from recommenders. In this process new data is integrated with prior evidence to produce a new hypothesis. In a typical scenario, thousands of genes need to be ranked by their relevance to a disease given new and existing data. As a case study we focused on finding out why some lung cancer patients develop resistance to treatments. Current protocol to find resistance markers starts with high-throughput genomic screens resulting in an initial list of potential gene candidates, followed by tedious manual curation by several experts to reduce the list to a manageable number for further follow-up. To find resistance markers faster and to reduce bias we built a hybrid recommendation system on top of a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph [2]. In the absence of continuous feedback and training data, we approached recommendations as a multi-objective optimization problem [4]. Genes were ranked by trading off diverse types of evidence that link them to potential mechanisms of resistance in lung cancer. We used a knowledge graph as the primary source of features, so that the relevance of a gene could be expressed via properties of a graph. Our hybrid feature set also included clinical and pre-clinical data as well as metrics of literature support obtained with natural language processing techniques. This hybrid approach helped to identify novel resistance mechanisms that could have been overlooked by experts due to inherent bias or limited integration of data. Most importantly, our method reduced the time required to prioritise resistance markers from months to minutes and became a standard procedure for processing genomic screens. Another class of problems exists around target identification tasks. The idea here is to find a molecular target, often a gene or a protein, that could be modulated with a drug to treat a disease. As the number of potential targets is large, the search space can be reduced using network propagation on a dedicated subgraph that captures the functional relationship between genes. This approach also requires a set of seed genes, defined based on high confidence associations with diseases. Disease preferences are then propagated through the network resulting in a preference distribution for the complete set of genes which is used to reduce the search space. In contrast to adding context to experiments, a considerable amount of training data is available to support target identification. For instance, both successful and failed clinical trials can act as a useful source of data for target identification. Such a setting warrants use of supervised recommendation systems. A supervised approach, however introduces another machine learning hurdle-trust. Since supervised models are typically "black boxes", their quality must be ascertained indirectly, for example using train-test split and estimating model's performance on the test set. Such quantitative performance metrics often are of little value to a biological expert looking for relevant gene targets. Instead, experts instinctively assess model quality by checking if a list of recommendations contains a handful of expected genes [9]. To simultaneously use biologists' intuitions as training data, while avoiding an overly optimistic trust in model output, we used an ensemble modeling approach. We partitioned training data among multiple models such that each available training gene was omitted from one model's training data. The model was then permitted to assess this previously unseen gene in constructing its final list of recommendations, while training genes were removed from consideration. Each model therefore produced a list of recommendations based on an incomplete set of genes. A final set of recommendations was then constructed by collating each individual model's output list. Because these output lists were constructed with biologist input through supervised training, biologists placed a higher degree of trust in the recommendations. This allowed roughly two dozen genes to be fast-tracked for manual assessment and experimental screening. In summary, accumulation of large amounts of biomedical data coupled with a need to comprehend and reason about it makes drug discovery an attractive field to apply recommendation techniques. Specifics of the problem space and complexity of biological systems call for efficient recommendation solutions that could operate in unsupervised or weakly supervised settings. At the same time, a strong emphasis on explainability is essential to gain trust of biomedical experts.},

Learning the user's preferences from all the possible sources of information in an extensive, multi-dimensional social network is one of the main challenges when building such recommenders. Graph Neural Networks have been gaining momentum in recent years and have been successful when dealing with large-scale graphs, and they can be applied to social networks with some modifications. In this research, we propose the HeteroGraphRec, which provides social recommendations by modeling the social network as a heterogeneous graph and utilizing GNNs with attention mechanisms to intelligently aggregate information from all sources when building the connections between user to user, item to item, and user to item. The HeteroGraphRec can gather information about the user's connections (friendships, trust network), item interaction history, and item similarities to attain rich information about the preferences. To evaluate the HeteroGraphRec, we use three real-world benchmark datasets and demonstrate that the proposed HeteroGraphRec achieves superior performance compared to ten other state-of-the-art social recommender systems. We extensively analyze the HeteroGraphRec model to illustrate the effectiveness by changing the embedding dimensions of the users and items. We also show the interpretability of our model by examining each component of the model's contribution. The results show that the HeteroGraphRec is robust and can consistently perform better than the baseline systems.},

abstract = {Recent work in recommender systems has emphasized the importance of fairness, with a particular interest in bias and transparency, in addition to predictive accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the state of the art pairwise ranking model, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has previously been found to outperform pointwise models in predictive accuracy, while also being able to handle implicit feedback. Specifically, we address two limitations of BPR: (1) BPR is a black box model that does not explain its outputs, thus limiting the user's trust in the recommendations, and the analyst's ability to scrutinize a model's outputs; and (2) BPR is vulnerable to exposure bias due to the data being Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This exposure bias usually translates into an unfairness against the least popular items because they risk being under-exposed by the recommender system. In this work, we first propose a novel explainable loss function and a corresponding Matrix Factorization-based model called Explainable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (EBPR) that generates recommendations along with item-based explanations. Then, we theoretically quantify additional exposure bias resulting from the explainability, and use it as a basis to propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal EBPR loss. The result is a ranking model that aptly captures both debiased and explainable user preferences. Finally, we perform an empirical study on three real-world datasets that demonstrate the advantages of our proposed models.},

Therefore, the quality of the recommendations for the users of these systems is very important. One of the recommender systems models is collaborative filtering (CF) which uses the ratings given by the users to the items. But many of these ratings may be noisy or inaccurate so they reduce the quality of the recommendations. Sometimes users, using fake profiles, try to change the recommendations in their favor. Since satisfaction and trust in such systems are very important and useful, it would be better to find a way to identify these types of users. Despite numerous studies on CF recommender systems, the design of a robust recommender system is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we have analyzed the 25 previous samples of research on collaborative filtering recommender system (CFRS) for attack detection from 2009 to 2019. Most of these papers focus mainly on movie recommendations. According to these analyzes, we have categorized attack detection methods on CFRS in four categories: clustering, classifying, feature extraction and probabilistic approaches.

The novelty of our approach concerns the modelling of the credibility of the user, through his/her trust and commitment in the social network. Moreover, in order to optimize the performance of the recommendation process, we have used two classification techniques: an unsupervised technique that uses the K-means algorithm (applied initially to all users); and a supervised technique that uses the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (applied to newly added users). A recommendation algorithm has been proposed taking into account the cold-start and sparsity problems. A prototype of a recommender system has been developed and tested using two publicly available datasets: the Yelp database and the Rich Epinions database.

Personalized location-based services built upon these methods have a few limitations such as low recommendation accuracy and untapped potential interests of users. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient POI recommendation method based on multiple factors (i.e., preference, social relationship, and spatial–temporal factors) to improve the recommendation accuracy and alleviate the cold-start and sparsity problems. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method considers the features of each factor. First, we identify direct and indirect trust relationships, upon which the improved trust relationship measurement methods are built respectively. Second, we fuse the comprehensive trust relationship, user preference, check-in time, and geographical location into a matrix factorization model. We pay special attention to the attraction of items, correlation between items, trajectory composed of locations, and the influence of interest-forgetting during the fusing process. Finally, we generate recommendation lists of POIs for the target users. With three real-world datasets, experimental and analytical results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, while alleviating the cold-start and sparsity problems that commonly hinder POI recommender systems. Theoretically, our study contributes to the effective usage of multidimensional data science and analytics for POI recommender system design. In practice, our results can be used to improve the quality of personalized POI recommendation services for websites and applications.},

abstract = {Electronic commerce has been growing gradually over the last decade as a new driver of the retail industry. In fact, the growth of e-Commerce has caused a significant rise in the number of choices of products and services offered on the Internet. This is where recommender systems come into play by providing meaningful recommendations to consumers based on their needs and interests effectively. However, recommender systems are still vulnerable to the scenarios of sparse rating data and cold start users and items. To develop an effective e-Commerce recommender system that addresses these limitations, we propose a Trust-Semantic enhanced Multi-Criteria CF (TSeMCCF) approach that exploits the trust relations and multi-criteria ratings of users, and the semantic relations of items within the CF framework to achieve effective results when sufficient rating data are not available. The experimental results have shown that the proposed approach outperforms other benchmark recommendation approaches with regard to recommendation accuracy and coverage.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RS) have demonstrated great success in information seeking. Recent years have witnessed a large number of work on inventing recommendation models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, etc. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and develop debiasing strategies when necessary. Therefore, bias issues and solutions in recommender systems have drawn great attention from both academic and industry. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an systemic review of existing work on this topic. We will introduce six types of biases in recommender system, along with their definitions and characteristics; review existing debiasing solutions, along with their strengths and weaknesses; and identify some open challenges and future directions. We hope this tutorial could stimulate more ideas on this topic and facilitate the development of debiasing recommender systems.},

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for top-N item recommendation, which uses three different kinds of information: user-item rating data, social network among the users, and tags associated with the items. The proposed method has mainly five steps: (i) creation of neighbor users' item set, (ii) construction of the user-feature matrix, (iii) computation of user priority, (iv) computation of item priority, and finally, (v) recommendation based on the item priority. We implement the proposed methodology with three recommendation dataset. We compare our results with that of the obtained from some state-of-the-art ranking methods and observe that recommendation accuracy is improved in the case of the proposed algorithm for both all users and cold-start users scenarios.

This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for a deeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this study, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior.},

abstract = {In the current research, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) play a decisive role in learning from network data structure. In a social recommender system, GNNs have a significant perspective to integrate the structure of a customer-customer social network and the customer-product bipartite network. Most of the existing trust-based social recommendation systems overlook heterogeneous trust relations among customers and heterogeneous interactions between customers and products. However, this is very challenging to capture these heterogeneous information. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to evaluate the authenticity of reviews written by customers on products. Varying authenticity introduces the heterogeneity in trust relations among customers and interactions between customers and products. This authenticity defines a customer's characteristic as a reviewer, whether the customer is reliable or biased. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which includes authenticity of reviews and customers to evaluate trust relationships and interactions. We develop a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for Trust-based Social Recommendation (GNNTSR) that systematically models two networks, i.e., customer-customer social network and customer-product bipartite network, and integrates heterogeneous trust and interaction. Extensive experiments are performed on real datasets, and empirical results show our model improves over the current best baseline by 2.16 - 5.74%.},

Although the recommender systems based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) are competent, the user trust information is seldom taken into consideration to improve the recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Trust-Aware GAN with recurrent neural network (RNN) for RECommender systems named TagRec, which makes use of the user trust information for top-N recommendation. In the framework, the discriminative model is a multilayer perceptron to distinguish whether a sample is from the real data or fake data generated by the generative model. The discriminator helps to guide the training of the generative model to make it fit the data distribution of the user trust information. The generative model is a RNN with long short-term memory cells, aiming to confuse the discriminative model by generating samples as similar as possible to the real data. Through the adversarial training between the discriminative and generative models, the user trust information can be fully used to improve the recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real-word data sets to validate the effectiveness of the TagRec by comparing it with the benchmarks.},

abstract = {User-item rating interactions in the recommender system have a deep potential connection with the friend relationships in the social network. In short, users who like the same kind of items may be potential friends in social network, and vice versa, friends in social networks tend to like similar items. Although the above-mentioned two kinds of interactive information can complement and inspire each other, either of them is sparse, which is still not enough to make accurate recommendations. In order to make up for this defect, we then mine useful information from attribute information, learning more informative node representation. In this paper, we explore attribute learning and mutual utilization, complementation and inspiration between social data and rating data. We propose a generic Attribute-Aware Multi-task Recommendation framework (AAMR) for rating prediction and social prediction, which learns representations for users and items by preserving both rating data and social data and attribute information, so as to conduct both rating prediction and trust relationship prediction tasks. Because many users are both in the rating matrix and in social networks, in the common learning, the two tasks will share the embedding of users, which makes the social data and rating data enrich each other's semantics and alleviate each other's sparsity. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art rating and trust prediction approaches, AAMR can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on both tasks.},

abstract = {Purpose: Measuring the similarity between two resources is considered difficult due to a lack of reliable information and a wide variety of available information regarding the resources. Many approaches have been devised to tackle such difficulty. Although content-based approaches, which adopted resource-related data in comparing resources, played a major role in similarity measurement methodology, the lack of semantic insight on the data may leave these approaches imperfect. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate data semantics into the measuring process. Design/methodology/approach: The emerged linked open data (LOD) provide a practical solution to tackle such difficulty. Common methodologies consuming LOD mainly focused on using link attributes that provide some sort of semantic relations between data. In this work, methods for measuring semantic distances between resources using information gathered from LOD were proposed. Such distances were then applied to music recommendation, focusing on the effect of various weight and level settings. Findings: This work conducted experiments using the MusicBrainz dataset and evaluated the proposed schemes for the plausibility of LOD on music recommendation. The experimental result shows that the proposed methods electively improved classic approaches for both linked data semantic distance (LDSD) and PathSim methods by 47 and 9.7%, respectively. Originality/value: The main contribution of this work is to develop novel schemes for incorporating knowledge from LOD. Two types of knowledge, namely attribute and path, were derived and incorporated into similarity measurements. Such knowledge may reflect the relationships between resources in a semantic manner since the links in LOD carry much semantic information regarding connecting resources.},

abstract = {Learning user representations based on historical behaviors lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Recent advances in sequential recommenders have convincingly demonstrated high capability in extracting effective user representations from the given behavior sequences. Despite significant progress, we argue that solely modeling the observational behaviors sequences may end up with a brittle and unstable system due to the noisy and sparse nature of user interactions logged. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate and robust user representations, which are required to be less sensitive to (attack on) noisy behaviors and trust more on the indispensable ones, by modeling counterfactual data distribution. Specifically, given an observed behavior sequence, the proposed CauseRec framework identifies dispensable and indispensable concepts at both the fine-grained item level and the abstract interest level. CauseRec conditionally samples user concept sequences from the counterfactual data distributions by replacing dispensable and indispensable concepts within the original concept sequence. With user representations obtained from the synthesized user sequences, CauseRec performs contrastive user representation learning by contrasting the counterfactual with the observational. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world public recommendation benchmarks and justify the effectiveness of CauseRec with multi-aspects model analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed CauseRec outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders by learning accurate and robust user representations.},

Modern recommendation systems often use side information to alleviate these problems and also increase prediction accuracy. One such piece of side information, which has been widely investigated, is trust. However, it is difficult to obtain explicit trust relationship data, so researchers infer trust values from other methods, such as the user-to-item relationship. In this paper, addressing the problems, we proposed a novel trust-based recommender model called UITrust, which uses user-item relationship value to improve prediction accuracy. With the improvement the traditional similarity measures by employing the entropies of user and item history ratings to reflect the global rating behavior on both. We evaluate the proposed model using two real-world datasets. The proposed model performs significantly better than the baseline methods.

abstract = {Optimal performance of collaborative tasks requires consideration of the interactions between socially intelligent agents, such as social robots, and their human counterparts. The functionality and success of these systems lie in their ability to establish and maintain user trust; with too much or too little trust leading to over-reliance and under-utilisation, respectively. This problem highlights the need for an appropriate trust calibration methodology, with the work in this paper focusing on the first step: investigating user trust as a behavioural prior. Two pilot studies (Study 1 and 2) are presented, the results of which inform the design of Study 3. Study 3 investigates whether trust can determine user decision making and task outcome during a human-agent collaborative task. Results demonstrate that trust can be behaviourally assessed in this context using an adapted version of the Trust Game. Further, an initial behavioural measure of trust can significantly predict task outcome. Finally, assistance type and task difficulty interact to impact user performance. Notably, participants were able to improve their performance on the hard task when paired with correct assistance, with this improvement comparable to performance on the easy task with no assistance. Future work will focus on investigating factors that influence user trust during human-agent collaborative tasks and providing a domain-independent model of trust calibration.},

abstract = {Cross-domain recommendation is becoming increasingly popular recently. Existing cross-domain recommendation often assumes that, a sufficient set of bridged users across domains is given in advance which disregards the scenario with insufficient bridged users. In this paper, we propose a novel Trust-aware Latent Space Mapping approach for Cross-domain Recommendation, called TLSM-CDR. This represents one of the first attempts to address the challenge of insufficient bridged users from the perspective of users' trust relationships to facilitate user sharing cross-domain recommendation. First, our model employs the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) to generate user and item matrices. Then, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and graph Laplacian are seamlessly incorporated into our trust-aware non-linear mapping function to capture the latent space relationships between both bridged and non-bridged users. Finally, we predict the optimized users' rating matrix in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, our TLSM-CDR model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

However, it is a challenging issue to how to apply deep neural networks on different resources and how to integrate their results. In this regard, we propose a recommender system in this paper based on deep sparse autoencoder and particle swarm optimization. In particular, a deep sparse autoencoder is utilized to learn latent features based on the ratings matrix, trust relationships, and tag information. Then, particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimal weights of these latent features in calculating unknown ratings. Experiments on two datasets show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with state of the art recommender algorithms.},

abstract = {System recommendation is currently on the rise: more and more e-commerce rely on this feature to give more privilege to their users. However, system recommendation still faces a lot of problems that can lead to its downfall. For instance, the cold start problem and lack of privacy for user's data in system recommendation will make the quality of this system lesser than ever. Moreover, e-commerce also faces another significant issue which is the lack of social presence. Compared to offline shopping, online shopping in e-commerce may be seen as lacking human presence and sociability as it is more impersonal, cold, automated, and generally devoid of face-to-face interactions. Hence, all of those issues mentioned above may lead to the regression of user's trust toward e-commerce itself. This study will focus on solving those problems using conversational design interaction in the form of a Virtual Agent. This Virtual Agent can help e-commerce gather user preferences and give clear and direct information regarding the use of user's data as well as help the user find products, promo, or similar products that they seek in e-commerce. The final result of this solution is a high fidelity prototype designed using User-Centered Design Methodology and Natural Conversational Framework. The implementation of this solution is carried out in Shopee e-commerce by modifying their product recommendation system. This prototype was measured using the usability testing method for usability goals efficient to use and user experience goals helpful.},

However, the traditional advertising push can't meet the needs of users for personalized advertising, resulting in users' resistance to advertising, which brings great challenges to advertising push. As an effective means to deal with these challenges, personalized advertising recommendation system has become one of the hottest research topics in the field of personalized services. Personalized advertising recommendation system obtains users' interests and preferences, uses a variety of personalized advertising recommendation technologies, provides personalized advertising for users through PC-side, mobile terminals and other platforms, and has achieved good results in some application systems. Therefore, personalized advertising recommendation system can alleviate the influence on users caused by the content of advertisements does not meet the needs of users, or the time or location of advertisements is not appropriate. At the same time, personalized advertising recommendation system can effectively deal with the challenges brought by advertisement recommendation due to the negative emotions of users and the decrease of advertising profits, and reduce users' resistance to advertisements and enhance user experience, which not only meets users' personalized needs, but also considers the economic benefits generated by advertisements. This paper summarizes the research progress of personalized advertising recommendation system. Starting from the introduction of personalized advertising recommendation, this paper expounds the differences between this paper and the review of the existing advertising recommendation system, and leads to the writing motivation of this paper.

abstract = {An ontology is a formal representation of domain knowledge as a set of concepts and their relationships in structured format. Besides various applications, ontology has been frequently used for the development of movie recommender systems that aim to predict the rating a user would give to a movie. Though recommender system is a well-studied research field, issues like cold-start, data sparsity, limited-content, and long tail are still open challenges. Context-aware recommender systems have been considered by many researchers to deal with some of these issues. However, non-existence of domain ontology containing contextual information is the major hindrance for the development of such systems. This is mainly due to the fact that datasets used in most of the existing context-aware recommender systems are either synthetic or generated through surveys. In this paper, we present the development of a context-aware movie ontology (CAMO) that contains movie concepts, relationships, and various representational and interactional contextual features. Since existing movie databases do not contain all contextual features, we have generated a real-world movie dataset from Linked Open Data (LOD) and movie databases like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes that contain complete context-based movie profiles. CAMO contains the conceptualization of total 1103 movies. Since users generally express their opinion over the interactional features like story, direction, music, visual effects, etc. of the movies, CAMO also contains aspect-based sentiment polarity identified from the reviews generated by 78056 users and 235 critics. The usefulness of CAMO is empirically evaluated using two similarity measures and two state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and it seems a useful movie knowledgebase for the development of context-aware movie recommendation systems. The source code of CAMO is uploaded at https://github.com/vineet-sejwal/CAMO for research and academic reference purposes. The generated movie dataset containing movie details, user ratings, and reviews generated by both users and critics is also uploaded, and it can be used as a benchmark dataset to evaluate movie recommender systems.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to put forward a quarantine phased normalized multilevel trust based routing mechanism for mitigation of packet drop attacks in MANET. Design/methodology/approach: The new mechanism uses the Packet Forwarding Ratio, Residual energy, Connectivity Index, Link Quality Index and Control Flow Ratio to calculate the slotted trust value. Then final trust is calculated by balancing current slotted trust and historical trust. The enhancement in base routing protocol is performed to support trust notion, dissemination for isolation, and effective routing. Further, the quarantine phase algorithm is proposed to minimize the false positivity which makes trust based system more accurate. Dissemination procedure and local neighbourhood recommender system is employed for isolation of malicious node with increased accuracy. Findings: A reliable routing paradigm is presented that boosts the mitigation mechanism. The routing paradigm is enhanced with introduction of new fields in existing packets of generic routing protocol. This enhancement is done to incorporate the notion of trust. Some new packets added in base routing protocol to help in dissemination, validation and recommendation as well. With the help of this, a secure and reliable route is formed that helps in prevention of attacks. The advantage of new mechanism is that it accurately mitigate and isolate packet drop attacks with minimum routing overheads and maximum energy efficiency. The simulation of the proposed mechanism is performed using Java-Matlab Interface. Through simulation, validation of effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism on the basis of different parameters is performed against the published mechanism. From the analysis, it is found that NMTBR has 1.63% higher packet delivery ratio, 12.77 lower routing overhead and 17.59% higher battery efficiency than BEST. Originality/value: The focus of new mechanism is to calculate the trust with least number of communication packets, because communication packets consumes more energy than computation. In this context, we have integrated the notion of trust in base routing protocol to enhance the network life time.},

Trust management is an effective method to solve these problems by establishing trust relationships among interconnected IoT objects. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trust model based on recommendation filtering algorithm for the IoT systems. The utilization of sliding window and time decay function when calculating direct trust can greatly accelerate the convergence rate of trust evaluation. We design a recommendation filtering algorithm to effectively filter out bad recommendations and minimize the impact of malicious objects. An adaptive weight is developed to better combine direct trust and recommendation trust into synthesis trust so as to adapt to the dynamically hostile environment. In the simulation experiments, we compare our adaptive trust model with three related models: TBSM, NRB and NTM. The experimental results indicate that our trust model converges fast and the mean absolute error is always less than 0.05 when the proportion of malicious nodes is from 10% to 70%. The comparative experiments further verify the effectiveness of our trust model in terms of accuracy, convergence rate and resistance to trust related attacks.},

abstract = {In recent years, the ever-increasing number of cloud services has led to the service targeting issue. It becomes challenging to provide users with services that fit their needs. Recommender systems address the service targeting problem by helping users to easily retrieve services matching their tastes. Collaborative filtering-based methods are spreadly used recommendation approaches since numerous methods are based on them. However, most of them assume the stationarity of user profiles over time, which is an unrealistic consideration. Indeed, in practice, users' tastes are dynamic and therefore show a significant variability over time. Time-aware recommender systems effectively integrate the variability of users' needs to improve the recommendation quality. However, the recommendation credibility is another crucial requirement that is not met by those time-aware recommender systems that moreover badly deal with the data sparsity issue. To address the service targeting problem while meeting requirements on the recommendation reliability and the users' tastes variability, we propose in this paper a realistic temporal service recommendation approach based on implicit trust relationships inference. Our method integrates the time feature into the recommendation process in order to consider the instantaneity of users' needs. Our proposal is based on a trusted network that infers implicit trust relationships to ensure the recommendation credibility even in case of data sparsity. Experiments are conducted on real-world service invocations datasets. Our proposal is then compared to existing methods and displays valuable performances in terms of mean absolute error, root mean square error, and normalized discounted cumulative.},

Cold start means the lack of information to predict ratings of a user accurately. Because the user's prior experiences in the system are essential in trusting the recommendations, making the proper recommendations is very important in the early stages of interaction. In this paper, the aim is to solve the problem of partial user cold start by gathering the information of the trust network and users ratings. In this approach, the trust network information and user ratings are first aggregated by the GraphSAGE neural network algorithm to extract the user's hidden features vector. Then, user ratings are predicted in each cluster of users. This method, which has been evaluated on two data sets, in the best case, improves the accuracy of predicting non-existing ratings for partially cold start users in terms of mean absolute error by 0.9% and root mean squared error by 1.1% compared to previous methods. Also, due to the inductivity of the GraphSAGE algorithm, if a new user (a user who was not available in the data set during the training process) enters, there is no need to retrain the model, and its embedding vector is created with the existing model.},

abstract = {We investigate a privacy-preserving problem for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation system for rapidly growing location-based social networks (LBSNs). The LBSN-based recommendation algorithms usually consider three factors: user similarity, social influence between friends and geographical influence in. The LBSN-based recommendation system first needs to collect relevant information of users and then provide them with potentially interesting contents. However, sensitive information of users may be leaked when the recommendation is provided. In this article, we focus on preventing user's privacy from disclosure upon geographical location and friend relationship factors. We propose a geographical location privacy-preserving algorithm (GLP) that achieves 〈r,h〉-privacy and present a friend relationship privacy-preserving algorithm (FRP) through adding Laplacian distributed noise for fusing the user trusts. Subsequently, we integrate the GLP and FRP algorithms into a general recommendation system and build a privacy-preserving recommendation system. The novel system enjoys the privacy guarantee under the metric differential entropy through theoretical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate a good trade-off between privacy and accuracy of the proposed recommendation system.},

However, little is known about how review-based explanations can be effectively and efficiently presented to users of RS. We investigate the potential of interactive explanations in review-based RS in the domain of hotels, and propose an explanation scheme inspired by dialogue models and formal argument structures. Additionally, we also address the combined effect of interactivity and different presentation styles (i.e. using only text, a bar chart or a table), as well as the influence that different user characteristics might have on users' perception of the system and its explanations. To such effect, we implemented a review-based RS using a matrix factorization explanatory method, and conducted a user study. Our results show that providing more interactive explanations in review-based RS has a significant positive influence on the perception of explanation quality, effectiveness and trust in the system by users, and that user characteristics such as rational decision-making style and social awareness also have a significant influence on this perception.},

The paper addresses basic algorithms for designing recommender systems (content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrids), and corresponding similarity metrics (cosine distance, Pearson correlation coefficient). The interest in hybrid systems is due to the fact that combining different modelling methods can improve not only the accuracy of rating predictions but also other characteristics of a recommender system, such as novelty, serendipity, diversity. In the course of the study, three approaches were used: content-based, collaborative and hybrid ones. As a result, two best models were chosen based on the first two approaches, with reference to which a hybrid model was built, whose quality was evaluated through a survey of potential users of the system. This made it possible to cover a whole range of evaluation criteria for recommender systems and understand corresponding user requirements. Trust to the system turned out to be the most important one. In other words, it means the extent to which the user is confident that he or she will actually like the recommendations suggested. Recommender systems were tested using open source data of the MovieLens dataset. This makes it possible to verify the results and improve the models suggested.},

abstract = {In the futuristic Industry framework, user interactions with the product are seamlessly integrated with the product life cycle which results in Information overload. The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user's personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user's behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches. MAE and RMSE scores on the Yelp dataset are 0.85 and 1.51, respectively. Additionally, MAE and RMSE scores on the Amazon dataset are 0.66 and 0.93, respectively, which clearly reflects the significant contribution of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Recommender System (RS) is an information filtering approach that helps the overburdened user with information in his decision making process and suggests items which might be interesting to him. While presenting recommendation to the user, accuracy of the presented list is always a concern for the researchers. However, in recent years, the focus has now shifted to include the unexpectedness and novel items in the list along with accuracy of the recommended items. To increase the user acceptance, it is important to provide potentially interesting items which are not so obvious and different from the items that the end user has rated. In this work, we have proposed a model that generates serendipitous item recommendation and also takes care of accuracy as well as the sparsity issues. Literature suggests that there are various components that help to achieve the objective of serendipitous recommendations. In this paper, fuzzy inference based approach is used for the serendipity computation because the definitions of the components overlap. Moreover, to improve the accuracy and sparsity issues in the recommendation process, cross domain and trust based approaches are incorporated. A prototype of the system is developed for the tourism domain and the performance is measured using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), unexpectedness, precision, recall and F-measure.},

Capturing the temporal dynamics of user preferences is essential to design an efficient personalized recommender system and has recently attracted significant attention. In this paper, we consider user preferences change individually over time. Moreover, based on the intuition that social influence can affect the users' preferences in a recommender system, we propose a Temporal and Social Collective Matrix Factorization model called TSCMF for recommendation. We jointly factorize the users' rating information and social trust information in a collective matrix factorization framework by introducing a joint objective function. We model user dynamics into this framework by learning a transition matrix of user preferences between two successive time periods for each individual user. We present an efficient optimization algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent for solving the objective function. The experiments on a real-world dataset illustrate that the proposed model outperforms the competitive methods. Moreover, the complexity analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can be scaled up to large datasets.},

Previous research has mainly investigated how persuasive recommendations can be improved by focusing on the non-verbal/verbal behavior of robots. However, to use robots as recommendation systems every day, it is extremely important to examine the persistence of repeated persuasion over a long term, rather than the effect of one-time persuasion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the persistence of repeated persuasive of robots. For this purpose, robots with three types of behavior (Expert Behavior, Local Behavior, and Growth Behavior) recommended nutrition bars in a situation of daily consumption behavior for two weeks. We could confirm significant differences in the persistent persuasiveness in each behavior. The results suggested that the combination of value co-creation using local information and meta-trust expression had a significant impact on the persistence of the repeated persuasiveness of the robots in the longitudinal period. However, the acceptance of the recommendation robot system decreased due to the increase in the amount of information during recommendation; therefore, a new recommend system to solve this problem is desired.},

We believe that a recommender system could help to select the members of a team by taking into account individual competences criteria, as well as the relationships between people. One important aspect of this relationship is the trust that members have with each other. However, this concept of trust remains difficult to be used because it is subject to many definitions and is complex to grasp. We try in this research to shed some light on the notion of trust. In particular, we study if there is a correspondence between a previously declared trust (off-line) and an actual trust put into practice during an experiment. To use the trust to recommend profiles of competences that stem from a wider and more reliable social network, we also investigate if the use of transitivity and reciprocity for trust makes sense.},

However, clustering-based recommender systems suffer from relatively low accuracy and coverage. To address these issues, we propose in this article an optimized multiview clustering approach for the recommendation of items in social networks. First, the selection of the initial medoids is optimized using the Bees Swarm optimization algorithm (BSO) in order to generate better partitions (i.e. refining the quality of medoids according to the objective function). Then, the multiview clustering (MV) is applied, where users are iteratively clustered from the views of both rating patterns and social information (i.e. friendships and trust). Finally, a framework is proposed for testing the different alternatives, namely: (1) the standard recommendation algorithms; (2) the clustering-based and the optimized clustering-based recommendation algorithms using BSO; and (3) the MV and the optimized MV (BSO-MV) algorithms. Experimental results conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BSO-MV algorithm in terms of improving accuracy, as it outperforms the existing related approaches and baselines.},

Limited content analysis, cold-start and data sparsity are well-known issues in traditional RSs, which occurs when few or no features describe the items or no ratings to achieve a recommendation task.

However, these may limit their application in practice. Hence, in this paper we propose the Reversible Data Transform (RDT) algorithm based privacy-preserving data collection protocol. Our protocol allows us to achieve privacy preservation against beyond the scope processing and does not require a private channel or rely on a third-party authentication. Due to group formation, the disclosure probability of the internal disclosure attack will not be greater than 1/k.

Some existing semantic measures based on Linked Open Data (LOD) are likely to play a positive role in this research area. According to the different LOD information used, we analyze two classes of semantic measures (similarity and relatedness) to explore the relationship between LOD-based domain correlation and user interests, and study the performance of different semantic measures on a cross-domain recommendation framework. Through experiments on a real-world dataset, this work has identified that the similarity measures can accurately capture the user's existing interests while the relatedness measures can produce diverse recommendations. Besides, by comparing with some representative methods, the experiment demonstrated that the cross-domain recommendation method could provide users with satisfactory recommendations even in the cold-start scenario.},

It filters appropriate information for user decisions. The most popular approaches of recommendation systems are content-based and collaborative filtering-based, which are created as a model by using user preferences and providing recommendations. Additionally, the hybrid approach is proposed to improve recommendations typically by combining the advantages of two techniques to increase efficiency and prediction performance. However, general recommendation systems typically abandon users' contextual preferences such as culture, emotions, and other details in different situations. Researchers are attempting to apply knowledge from other scientific fields to improve the performance of their recommendation systems. Psychology is one of approaches that can be applied to understand and explain humanity and shows that emotions influence decision-driven, efficient, and predictable. This paper reviews relevant research analyzes state-of-arts, gaps, and further recommendation system research based on emotion. We find that most of the selected research use sentiment data extracted from open data sources and social networks. As for the data extraction and data analysis depend on data sciences and statistics theory, and Cold start is still a challenge for researchers. However, we find that the data from social media reaction can compare with the emotional wheel in psychology and present emotion as more complex than sentiment. Future research on an individual recommendation system will bring the complexity of psychological emotion into improving the system.},

Evaluation of smoking interventions is one area where vested interests may motivate reduced reproducibility and transparency. Aims. Assess markers of transparency and reproducibility in smoking behaviour change intervention evaluation reports. Methods. One hundred evaluation reports of smoking behaviour change intervention randomised controlled trials published in 2018-2019 were identified. Reproducibility markers of pre-registration; protocol sharing; data, material, and analysis script sharing; replication of a previous study; and open access publication were coded in identified reports. Transparency markers of funding and conflict of interest declarations were also coded. Coding was performed by two researchers, with inter-rater reliability calculated using Krippendorff's alpha. Results. Seventy-one percent of reports were open access, and 73% were pre-registered. However, there are only 13% provided accessible materials, 7% accessible data, and 1% accessible analysis scripts. No reports were replication studies. Ninety-four percent of reports provided a funding source statement, and eighty-eight percent of reports provided a conflict of interest statement. Conclusions. Open data, materials, analysis, and replications are rare in smoking behaviour change interventions, whereas funding source and conflict of interest declarations are common. Future smoking research should be more reproducible to enable knowledge accumulation. This study was pre-registered: https://osf.io/yqj5p.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) have been adopted in a variety set of web services to provide a list of items which a user may interact with in near future. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most widely used mechanism in RSs that focuses on preferences of neighbours of similar users. Therefore, it is a critical challenge for CF models to discover a set of appropriate neighbors for a particular user. Most of the current approaches exploit users' ratings information to find similar users by comparing their rating patterns. However, this may be a simple idea and over-tested by the current studies, which may fail under data sparsity problem. Recommender system as an intelligent system needs to help users with their decision making process, and facilitate them with personalized suggestions. In real world, people are willing to share similar interest with those who have the same personality type; and then among all similar personality users pope may only take advice and recommendation from the trustworthy ones. Therefore, in this paper we propose a two-level model, TAP, which analyzes users' behaviours to first detect their personality types, and then incorporate trust information to provide more customized recommendations. We mathematically model our approach based on the matrix factorization to consider personality and trust information simultaneously. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

Due to this, social relations can help the recommender systems in solving cold-start and data sparsity problems. This paper presents a trust-based approach to extract social relations for recommendation in social networks. We use matrix factorization approach to factorize the user-item rating matrix. Both rating matrix and trusted relations play a crucial role in calculating the weighted trust between users in our proposed approach.

abstract = {Recommender systems are popular tools used in many applications, such as e-commerce, e-learning, and social networks to help users select their desired items. Collaborative filtering is a widely used recommendation technique that employs previous ratings of users to predict their future interests. Lack of sufficient ratings often reduces the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation methods. Additional side resources, such as trust relationships and tag information can be employed to enhance the recommendation accuracy. However, trust and tag data are often heavily sparse as users mainly provide insufficient information about these side resources. Moreover, such additional resources have generally large dimensions which result in increasing the computational complexity of recommendation models in calculating similarity values. To cope with these problems, a new recommendation model is proposed that utilizes deep neural networks to model the representation of trust relationships and tag information. To this end, a sparse autoencoder is used to extract latent features from user-user trust relationships and user-tag matrices. Then, the extracted latent features are utilized to calculate similarity values between users, which are then used to form the nearest neighbors of the target user and predict unseen items. The proposed method can tackle the data sparsity problem and reduce the computational complexity of recommender systems as the extracted latent features have smaller dimensions in comparison to the original data. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its outperformance over state-of-the-art recommender systems.},

The convergence of IoT with social networks (SIoT) interconnects multiple IoT applications and alleviates the common data sparsity and cold start problems in traditional recommendation systems. However, the social trust relationships may also be very sparse, which affects the accuracy of trust-based recommendation systems. Meanwhile, mobile devices have limited resources and are more vulnerable to malicious attacks in the IoT environment. In order to complete the trust relationship and further improve the trust-based recommendation performance, we propose a reliable and lightweight trust inference model for service recommendation in SIoT, called TIRec. Firstly, we obtain a comprehensive weighted centrality metric (LGWC) considering both local and global contexts. Based on this, we propose a corresponding lightweight trust path selection algorithm. Then, we present a reliable trust inference calculation algorithm consist of trust propagation and aggregation strategy, which can efficiently resist two common malicious attacks. Finally, we incorporate the rating, direct trust and indirect trust together into the matrix factorization model, and integrate the influence of truster and trustee to obtain the synthetic model for rating predication. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate trust inference algorithm into the trust-based recommendation systems.

abstract = {Recently, incorporating user information, social network information, item information and user ratings to improve recommendation performance has attracted great attention. However, most of the existing recommendation methods suffer from the following problems: (1) They only use user information, the item's information, or user ratings to make recommendations, thus, they demonstrate low recommendation accuracy. (2) They employ decision trees to execute user information and item information, therefore, they ignore the correlation between attributes, resulting in a decrease in recommendation performance. (3) It is difficult to cope with the problem of data sparsity. To address these problems, we propose a novel personalized recommendation algorithm by exploiting the individual trust and item's similarities, named PRAITIS. In PRAITIS framework, the zero-mean spherical Gaussian prior is first applied to the item feature vector, user feature vector, and user-rating-data matrix to obtain their latent feature space and the user-rating-data space. Then, Bayesian inference is used to get the posterior probability of potential features. Finally, under the condition that the hyper-parameters are fixed, the framework of the algorithm is obtained by maximizing the log-posterior probability of three potential features. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a series of experiments done on two real-world datasets (e.g., Douban and Epinions) show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and quality.},

abstract = {A group recommender system (GRS) is a system that collectively recommends items to a group of users based on their preferences. The GRS and the individual RS challenge lies in a very small and incompleteness of user-item ratings. Such incompleteness resulted in the data sparsity problem. The issues of data sparsity in a group negatively affect the quality of recommendations to the group. It occurs due to the inefficient formation of groups, which usually involves individuals with sparse data in their user profiles. Most of the current studies focus on this issue after the formation of groups. However, this study focused before the group formation, based on the intuition that it will be more efficient if the data sparsity at the individual level is addressed before the group formation process takes place. Therefore, applying the approach through Linked Open Data (LOD) technology is proposed to ensure that the data sparsity issues can be overcome before the group formation process is implemented. We proposed a GRS-LOD model. The experimental evaluations relating to the prediction accuracy and recommendation relevancy of the proposed model were implemented on three aspects: comparison with the basic approach or baselines; comparison with the current approaches, and comparison in terms of group size and aggregation strategies. The aggregation strategies used were the Average (AV), Most Pleasure (MP), Average without Misery (AVM), and Least Misery (LM). The metrics for prediction accuracy were based on the RMSE and MAE, whereas for relevancy, precision, recall, and F1-score were considered. The results show that the prediction accuracy and relevancy of the developed model's recommendations is better than the baseline study by adapting the Average (AV) strategy with the individual profile aggregation approach. Meanwhile, for the evaluation in terms of group size, the results show larger group size exhibits better prediction accuracy for the four used aggregation strategies. On the other hand, in terms of recommendation relevancy, the result shows that relevancy decreases with the increase in group size for the MP, AV and AVM strategies.},

abstract = {A recommender system (RS) provides assistance for users to filter out items of their interest in the presence of millions of available items. The reason is to find out the likewise user with the assumption that if users have shared similar interest in the past then they may share the same in future. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the widely used recommendation algorithm due to its ease of use but suffers with the problems of sparsity and cold start problem. In this paper, we propose a trust and distrust-based cross domain context aware recommender system in the multi-agent environment which tries to reduce the problem of data sparsity in collaborative-filtering recommender system and improves coverage. Cross Domain Recommender System (CDRS) utilizes data from multiple domains to reduce the problem of sparsity. Moreover, the combination of trust and distrust in recommendation help to improve trustworthiness of generated recommendation. Distrust provides higher accuracy in recommendation by incorporating knowledge about the malicious users. Prototype of the system is developed using JADE and Java technology for the tourism domain consisting of restaurant, hotel, travel places and shopping places as sub-domains. The performance of the proposed trust and distrust-based cross domain recommender system is compared with the traditional approach of recommendation along with the cross domain approach and trust-based cross-domain approach in terms of accuracy and coverage. The results show that the proposed system outperforms in terms of both accuracy and coverage.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems have improved the accuracy of recommendations through the use of complex algorithms; however, users struggle to understand why the items are recommended and hence become anxious. Therefore, it is crucial to explain the reason for the recommended items to provide transparency and improve user satisfaction. Recent studies have adopted local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) as an interpretation model by treating the recommendation model as a black box; this approach is called a post-hoc approach. In this chapter, we propose a new method based on LIME to improve the model fidelity, i.e., the recall of the interpretation model to the recommendation model. Our idea is to select an optimal number of explainable features in the interpretation model instead of using complete features because the interpretation model becomes difficult to learn when the number of features increases. In addition, we propose a method to generate user-friendly explanations for users based on the features extracted by LIME. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to provide a post-hoc explanation with subjective experiments involving users to confirm the effectiveness of the method. The experimental evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method, named LIME-RS, with a 2.5%–2.7% higher model fidelity of top 50 recommended items. Furthermore, subjective evaluations conducted on 50 users for the generated explanations demonstrate that the proposed method is statistically superior to the baselines in terms of transparency, trust, and satisfaction.},

In this case, personalized recommendation system has become the main way to find favorite businesses, and also become the main means to sell goods on the platform. n the recommendation system of e-commerce platform, collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is the most widely used. The main idea of the algorithm is to find the similar neighbor set of the target user, and recommend the user preference of the neighbor set to the target user as a recommendation. In this paper, a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on context information is proposed, which focuses on the influence of user context information on the similarity calculation between users in the recommendation algorithm in the mobile Internet environment. The algorithm takes the user location information and user trust relationship as the key factors. First, the algorithm preprocesses the original score data through SVD to alleviate the scarcity of data, then generates a list of merchant candidate recommendations based on the score similarity of users Using collaborative filtering. And then calculates the travel cost of each merchant in the candidate recommendation list to the target user according to the location context, and adjusts the recommendation weight of the merchant in the list, Finally, the final Top-N merchants are generated to recommend to the target users. In the end of this paper, through the experimental simulation of the proposed algorithm, and compared with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, it is proved that the algorithm further improves the effectiveness and accuracy of the recommendation algorithm.},

abstract = {The interactions between group members often have a significant impact on the results of group recommendations. The traditional group recommendation algorithm does not consider the trust and social influence among users. It involves a low utilization rate of social relationship information, which leads to a low accuracy and satisfaction of group recommendations. Considering these issues, in this study, we propose a travel group recommendation model based on user trust and social influence. Based on the user trust relationship, this model defines the user direct and indirect trust and calculates the user global trust by combining the two trusts. Subsequently, the PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the social influence of users based on their interaction relationship history. Thereafter, a consensus model integrating the intra- and intergroup prediction scores is designed by integrating users' global trust and social influence to realize group recommendations for tourist attractions. Comparison experiments with several well-known group recommendation models for datasets of different scenic spots in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed model provides a better recommendation performance.},

Significantly, the YouTube algorithm's alleged contributions to the formation of echo-chambers, filter-bubbles, polarization, radicalization, disinformation, and malicious use of information are among the top concerns. On top of the given issues, potential biases of the recommendation system in favor of a small number of videos, content producers, or channels would further exacerbate the magnitude of the problem, especially if a systematic understanding of the inherent nature and characteristics of the algorithm is lacking. In this study, we investigate the structure of recommendation networks and probabilistic distributions of the node-centric influence of recommended videos. Adopting a stochastic approach, we observe PageRank distributions over a diverse set of recommendation graphs we collected and built based on eight different real-world scenarios. In total, we analyzed 803,210 recommendations made by YouTube's recommendation algorithm, based on specific search queries and seed datasets from previous studies. As a result, we demonstrate the existence of a structural, systemic, and inherent tendency to impose bias by YouTube's video recommendation system in favor of a tiny fraction of videos in each scenario. We believe that this work sets the stage for further research in creating predictive modeling techniques that reduce bias in video recommendation systems and make algorithms fairer. The implementation of such attempts aims to reduce their potential harmful social and ethical impacts and increase public trust in these social systems.},

Applying hierarchical clustering to the results revealed distinct user groups and their respective mental models. Independent of the recommender system used, some participants held a strict procedural-based, others a concept-based mental model. Additionally, mental models can be characterized as either technical or humanized. While procedural-based mental models were positively related to transparency perception, humanized models might influence the perception of system trust. Based on these findings, we derive three implications for the consideration of user-specific mental models in the design of transparent intelligent systems.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed remarkable information overload in online social networks, and social network based approaches for recommender systems have been widely studied. The trust information in social networks among users is an important factor for improving recommendation performance. Many successful recommendation tasks are treated as the matrix factorization problems. However, the prediction performance of matrix factorization based methods largely depends on the matrixes initialization of users and items. To address this challenge, we develop a novel trust-aware approach based on deep learning to alleviate the initialization dependence. First, we propose two deep matrix factorization (DMF) techniques, i.e., linear DMF and non-linear DMF to extract features from the user-item rating matrix for improving the initialization accuracy. The trust relationship is integrated into the DMF model according to the preference similarity and the derivations of users on items. Second, we exploit deep marginalized Denoising Autoencoder (Deep-MDAE) to extract the latent representation in the hidden layer from the trust relationship matrix to approximate the user factor matrix factorized from the user-item rating matrix. The community regularization is integrated in the joint optimization function to take neighbours' effects into consideration. The results of DMF are applied to initialize the updating variables of Deep-MDAE in order to further improve the recommendation performance. Finally, we validate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for recommendation, especially for the cold-start users.},

RS is categorized into Content-Based (CB), collaborative Filtering (CF) and Hybrid RS. Based on these techniques recommendations are done to user. In this, CF is the recent technique used in RS in which tagging feature also provided. Objective: Three main issues occur in RS are scalability problem which occurs when there is a huge data, sparsity problem occurs when rating data is missing and cols start user or item problem occurs when new user or new item enters in the system.

Here, explanations are essential to improve user confidence in recommender systems and to make the recommendation useful. Providing explanation capabilities into recommender systems is not an easy task as their success depends on several aspects such as the explanation's goal, the user's expectation, the knowledge available, or the presentation method. Therefore, this work proposes a conceptual model to alleviate this problem by defining the requirements of explanations for recommender systems. Our goal is to provide a model that guides the development of effective explanations for recommender systems as they are correctly designed and suited to the user's needs.

abstract = {Objective: This work aims to further test the theory that trust mediates the interdependency between automation reliability and the rate of human reliance on automation. Background: Human trust in automation has been the focus of many research studies. Theoretically, trust has been proposed to impact human reliance on automation by mediating the relationship between automation reliability and the rate of human reliance. Experimentally, however, the results are contradicting as some confirm the mediating role of trust, whereas others deny it. Hence, it is important to experimentally reinvestigate this role of trust and understand how the results should be interpreted in the light of existing theory. Method: Thirty-two subjects supervised a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in foraging missions in which the swarm provided recommendations on whether or not to collect potential targets, based on the information sensed by the UAVs. By manipulating the reliability of the recommendations, we observed changes in participants' trust and their behavioral responses. Results: A within-subject mediation analysis revealed a significant mediation role of trust in the relationship between swarm reliability and reliance rate. High swarm reliability increased the rate of correct acceptances, but decreased the rate of correct rejections. No significant effect of reliability was found on response time. Conclusion: Trust is not a mere by-product of the interaction; it possesses a predictive power to estimate the level of reliance on automation. Application: The mediation role of trust confirms the significance of trust calibration in determining the appropriate level of reliance on swarm automation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are a subset of intelligent systems for information filtering systems that identify users' interests on the Internet. These systems provide appropriate and relevant suggestions related to the personal taste of the user by filtering the available information. Providing suggestions tailored to the needs and tastes of individuals and improving the efficiency of these systems increases users' trust in them. One of the most important challenges of recommender systems is the problem of data dispersion and cold start, that affects the performance of these systems. To confront these challenges, this paper uses a new method using trust information and combines it with negative matrix decomposition. In the proposed method, the use of collaborative filtering based on the negative analysis of the rank matrix enables us to compute a low rank approximation in order to manage large matrices. To solve the problem of cold start and data dispersion, the data of non-negative matrix decomposition algorithm and trust information has been used to improve the system of recommending to users. The results of experiments have been compared with state-of-the-art methods, which show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and a computational complexity.},

abstract = {Purpose: Tags help promote customer engagement on video-sharing platforms. Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users' trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform. Originality/value: The proposed model is not only the first explainable video tag recommender system but also the first explainable multimedia tag recommender system to the best of our knowledge.},

To deal with the problems, we first present a Trust-based Collaborative Filtering (TbCF) algorithm to perform basic rating prediction in a manner consistent with the existing CF methods. Then, we propose the Hybrid Collaborative Filtering Recommendation approach with User-Item-Trust Records (UIThybrid), a novel approach that incorporates user trust into the existing CF-based methods in a harmonious way to supplement rating information. UIThybrid employs multiple perspectives to extract proper services and achieves a good tradeoff between the robustness, accuracy, and diversity of the recommendation.

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of advanced mobile applications, people's various daily behavior data, such as geographic location, social information, hobbies, are more easily collected. To process these data, data cross-boundary fusion has become a key technology, and there are some challenges, such as solving the problems of the cross-boundary business integrity, cross-boundary value complementarity and so on. Mobile Services Recommendation requires improved recommendation accuracy. User trust is an effective measure of information similarity between users. Using trust can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendations. The existing methods have low utilization of general trust data, sparseness of trust data, and lack of user trust characteristics. Therefore, a method needs to be proposed to make up for the shortcomings of explicit trust relationships and improve the accuracy of user interest feature completion. In this paper, a recommendation model is proposed to mine the implicit trust relationships from user data and integrate the explicit social information of users. First, the rating prediction model was improved using the traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model, and the implicit trust relationships were mined from the user's historical data. Then, they were fused with the explicit social trust relationships to obtain a crossover data fusion model. We tested the model using three different orders of magnitude. We compared the user preference prediction accuracies of two models: one that does not integrate social information and one that integrates social information. The results show that our model improves the user preference prediction accuracy and has higher accuracy for cold start users. On the three data sets, the average error is reduced by 2.29%, 5.44% and 4.42%, suggesting that it is an effective data crossover fusion technology.},

Many current production-level integrity models are tightly coupled to a specific domain, (e.g., databases), or only apply after the fact (e.g., backups). In this paper we propose a recommendation-based trust model, called Admonita, for data integrity that is applicable to any structured data in a system and provides a measure of trust to applications on-the-fly. The proposed model is based on the Biba integrity model and utilizes the concept of an Integrity Verification Procedure (IVP) proposed by Clark-Wilson. Admonita incorporates subjective logic to maintain the trustworthiness of data and applications in a system. To prevent critical applications from losing trust, Admonita also incorporates the principle of weak tranquility to ensure that highly trusted applications can maintain their trust levels. We develop a simple algebra around these elements and describe how it can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of system entities. By applying subjective logic, we build a powerful, artificial and reasoning trust model for implementing data integrity.},

To overcome the inherent limitation, which is referred to as data sparsity in CF, various solutions are proposed to incorporate additional social information into recommendation processes, such as trust networks. However, existing methods suffer from multi-source data integration (i.e., fusion of social information and ratings), which is the basis for similarity calculation of user preferences. To this end, we propose a social collaborative filtering method based on novel trust metrics. Firstly, we use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn the associations between social information and user ratings while considering the underlying social network structures. Secondly, we measure the direct-trust values between neighbors by representing multi-source data as user ratings on popular items, and then calculate the indirect-trust values based on trust propagations. Thirdly, we employ all trust values to create a social regularization in user-item rating matrix factorization in order to avoid overfittings. The experiments on real datasets show that our approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on usage of multi-source data to alleviate data sparsity.},

However, data sparsity is more serious in tensor factorization, and it is difficult to build a more accurate recommender system only based on user–item–context interaction information. Making full use of user's social information and implicit feedback can alleviate this problem. In this paper, we propose a new tensor factorization model named TrustTF, which mainly works as follows: (1) Using user's social trust information and implicit feedback to extend the bias tensor factorization (BiasTF), effectively alleviate data sparsity problem and improve the recommendation accuracy; (2) Dividing user's trust relationship into unilateral trust and mutual trust, which makes better use of user's social information. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the effects of both user trust and implicit feedback on the basis of the BiasTF model. The experimental results in two real-world data sets demonstrate that the TrustTF proposed in this paper can achieve higher accuracy than BiasTF and other social recommendation methods.},

However, job seekers often hesitate to trust AI-based recommendations in this context given the far-reaching consequences of the importance of the decision for a job on their future career and life. This hesitation is largely driven by a lack of explainability, as underlying algorithms are complex and not clear to the user. Prior research suggests that anthropomorphization (i.e., the attribution of human traits) can increase the acceptance of technology. Therefore, we adapted this concept for AI-based recommender systems and conducted a survey-based study with 120 participants. We find that that using an anthropomorphic design in a recommender system for open positions increases job seekers' acceptance of the underlying system.

In this article, a new method is proposed to overcome the cold-start user problem. The main idea of this study is to apply a clustering technique using trust relations and rating information to compute the weights. First, the implicit relations are determined, and then the similarity is computed for each pair of explicit and implicit relations. Second, confidence values are determined through an information rating by dividing the number of common items for each pair of users by the number of items that have been rated by the first user of this pair. Furthermore, the similarity and confidence values are integrated to produce weight values, and then the distance values are inferred. Additionally, the partitioning around medoids clustering algorithm is adopted to cluster the users into groups according to their computed distances. Moreover, the Singular Value Decomposition Plus (SVD++) method is employed for each cluster to predict the items for cold-start users. Eventually, the proposed method is evaluated with two real-world datasets. The results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art trust methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

In view of the fact that blockchain technology, with its advantages in decentralization, immutability and traceability, has established a new trust model for global interconnection and brought transformative solutions to the pain points of various industries. We propose an educational resources-oriented fair recommendation system based on consortium blockchain to solve the above problems. Firstly, we unite schools, educational institutions and other organizations to build an education consortium blockchain. Then, experts and teachers extensively participate in the education consortium blockchain to make recommendations through the automatic execution of smart contracts. Besides, the data of the recommendation process is written into the blockchain ledger through the consensus mechanism, which allows participants to verify safely and reliably. Finally, the system test and analysis show that the system satisfies the fairness and credibility requirements of users and provides new ideas for the application of blockchain technology in education.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems are often used to solve the problem of information overload on the Internet. Many types of data can be used for recommendations, and fusing different types of data can make recommendations more accurate. Most existing fusion recommendation models simply combine the recommendation results from different data instead of fully fusing multi-source heterogeneous data to make recommendations. Furthermore, users' choices are usually affected by their direct and even indirect friends' preferences. This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation model BRS cS (an acronym for BPR-Review-Score-Social). It fully fuses social data, score, and review together; uses improved BPR model to optimize the ranking; and trains them in a joint representation learning framework to get the top-N recommendations. User trust model is used to introduce social relationships into the rating and review data, PV-DBOW model is used to process the review data, and fully connected neural network is used to process the rating data. Experiments on Yelp public dataset show that the BRS cS algorithm proposed outperforms other recommendation algorithms such as BRS c, UserCF, and HRS c. The BRS cS model is also scalable and can fuse new types of data easily.},

But “information cocoons” in an SN make recommendations homogeneity and vision narrow. We constructed a recommender network in which the trust relationship is derived from a social network viewpoint and found that the trust relation is measured more appropriate by group interactions in the SN than by using individual interactions. Through analyzing characters of fuzzy measures, we weigh non-additive trust relationships between groups in the trust network. Further, a weight determination model for the trust network in recommender systems, on the basis of the knowledge of trust values, is developed for obtaining fuzzy measures for the Choquet integral. The novelty of this model is that it applies parameters necessary to describe the trust complementary and redundancy between experts and Choquet integral and it also utilizes fuzzy measures to deduce the effect of trust complementary and redundancy in recommendations. The model can help remove deviations caused by interactions, and improve the accuracy and objectivity of recommendations.},

abstract = {Recommender systems face longstanding challenges in gaining users' trust due to the unreliable information caused by profile injection or human misbehavior. Traditional solutions to those challenges focus on leveraging users' social relationships for inferring the user preference, i.e., recommending items according to the preference by user's trusted friends; or adding random noise to the input to improve the robustness of the recommender systems. However, such approaches cannot defend the real-world noises like fake ratings. The recommender model is generally built upon all the user-item interactions, which incorporates the information from fake ratings or spammer groups, that neglects the reliability of the ratings. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial training approach in this work. In details, our approach includes two components: a predictor that infers the user preference; and a discriminator that enforces cohort rating patterns. In particular, the predictor applies an encoder-decoder structure to learn the shared latent information from sparse users' ratings and trust relationships; the discriminator enforces the predictor to provide ratings as coherent with the cohort rating patterns. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the advantages of our approach over several competitive baselines.},

Therefore, the demand for such activity recommendation is growing, but too many activities will inevitably make users confused and difficult to choose. Personalized recommendation system can help users filter out the content that they are not interested in or have a low evaluation, and recommend the content that they may be interested in to the participating users. However, the existing research focuses on the analysis of personal participation records, while the impact of dynamic interaction between participants on user participation preferences has not been explored, and the sparse user trust matrix and other problems hinder the improvement of recommendation performance.Therefore, it is important to integrate the social relationship dynamically into the personalized recommendation system. Secondly, considering that users trust different friends in different fields, in order to infer the social relations of users in specific fields more accurately, we will use network representation technology to embed the social trust relations in specific fields into low-dimensional space. We propose a personalized dynamic recommendation method integrating high-level similarity social relationships. The results show the superiority of the proposed model by comparing with the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have a wide range of applications, such as recommender systems, relation extraction, and intelligent question answering systems. However, existing KGs are far from complete. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) has been studied to complete KGs by inferring missing entities or relations. But most previous methods require that all entities should be seen during training, which is impractical for real-world KGs with new entities emerging daily. In this paper, we address the open-world KGR task: how to perform reasoning when entities are not observed at training time. The description-embodied knowledge representation learning (DKRL) model attempts to study the open-world KGR task. We find that DKRL does not consider hierarchical type information contained in entities when learning entities and relations representations, which results in poor performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel model, SDT, that incorporates the structural information, entity descriptions, and hierarchical type information of entities into a unified framework to learn more representative embeddings for KGs. Specifically, for entity descriptions, we explore continuous bag-of-words and convolutional neural networks models to encode the semantics of entity representations. For hierarchical types, we utilize a recursive hierarchy encoder and a weighted hierarchy encoder to construct the projection matrices of hierarchical types. We evaluate the SDT model on both open-world and closed-world reasoning tasks, including entity prediction and relation prediction. Experimental results on large-scale datasets show that SDT achieves a lower mean rank and higher Hits@10 than the baseline methods.},

A holistic knowledge representation of the issues affecting a domain is critical for research advancement. The aim of this study is to advance scholarly research within the domain of recommender systems through formal knowledge classification of issues and their relationships to one another within recommender systems research literature. In this study, we employ a rigorous ontology engineering process for development of a recommender system issues ontology. This ontology provides a formal specification of the issues affecting recommender systems research and development. The ontology answers such questions as, “What issues are associated with ‘trust' in recommender systems research?”, “What are issues associated with improving and evaluating the ‘performance' of a recommender system?” or “What ‘contextual' factors might a recommender systems developer wish to consider in order to improve the relevancy and usefulness of recommendations?” Additionally, as an intermediate representation step in the ontology acquisition process, a concept map of recommender systems issues has been developed to provide conceptual visualization of the issues so that researchers may discern broad themes as well as relationships between concepts. These knowledge representations may aid future researchers wishing to take an integrated approach to addressing the challenges and limitations associated with current recommender systems research.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) play a crucial role in helping users quickly find their desired services and promoting sales of service providers in e-commerce. However, service providers intentionally upload cherry-picked service information to mislead RSs for greater profit. Such misleading recommendations pose the risk of degrading user experience and gradually undermine users' confidence in the whole service market over the long term. Worse still, most current expert recommendation methods are more susceptible to such risk because they are heavily dependent on this incomplete service information and assume it is trusted. Therefore, how to satisfy users' service requirements with risks minimized at the same time motivates our work. In this paper, we first discern two risky facets that pose significant challenges to expert recommendation: Sense Drop and Blue Joy. Then we propose a unified framework called RecRisk, which integrates trust, heat equation, and modern portfolio theory to address the above challenges. The main contributions of RecRisk are twofold: (1) To select the services which satisfy the users' preferences, we design a trust-aware heat equation model (TAHE) that combines heat flow theory with trust elements. (2) We develop a flexible model based on modern portfolio theory to weigh users' satisfaction and services' risk facets, and finally recommend a ranked service list to users. Our experimental results demonstrate that RecRisk simultaneously achieves higher recommendation precision and decreases risks when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

The trust relationships in social networks can be utilized to reveal user preferences for improving the quality of social recommendation, which aims to mitigate information overload and provide users with the most attractive and relevant items or services. However, the data sparsity and cold-start issue degrade recommendation performance significantly. To address these issues, a novel trust-embedded collaborative deep generative model (TCDG) is proposed for exploiting multisource information (content, rating and trust) to predict ratings. TCDG employs deep generative model to unsupervisedly learn deep latent representations for item content through an inference network in latent space instead of observation space. Meanwhile, TCDG adopts probabilistic matrix factorization to map users into low-dimensional latent feature spaces by trust relationships, which can reflect users' mutual influence on the formation of users' opinions more accurately and learn better implicit relationships between items and users from content, rating and trust. In addition, an approach with an annealing parameter to calculate the maximum a posteriori estimates is proposed to learn model parameters. Experiments using four real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate the prediction and top-ranking performance of our model. The results indicate that TDCG has better accuracy and robustness than other methods for making recommendations.},

However, most existing explainable recommendation methods cannot provide multi-model explanations consisting of both textual and visual modalities or adaptive explanations tailored for the user's dynamic preference, potentially leading to the degradation of customers' satisfaction, confidence and trust for the recommender system. On the technical side, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has become the most prevalent technique to model dynamic user preferences. Benefit from the natural characteristics of RNN, the hidden state is a combination of long-term dependency and short-term interest to some degrees. But it works like a black-box and the monotonic temporal dependency of RNN is not sufficient to capture the user's short-term interest. In this paper, to deal with the above issues, we propose a novel Attentive Recurrent Neural Network (Ante-RNN) with textual and visual fusion for the dynamic explainable recommendation. Specifically, our model jointly learns image representations with textual alignment and text representations with topical attention mechanism in a parallel way. Then a novel dynamic contextual attention mechanism is incorporated into Ante-RNN for modelling the complicated correlations among recent items and strengthening the user's short-term interests. By combining the full latent visual-semantic alignments and a hybrid attention mechanism including topical and contextual attentions, Ante-RNN makes the recommendation process more transparent and explainable. Extensive experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the superior performance and explainability of our model.},

In many content-based recommendation systems we can find, along with discrete attributes, textual features (e.g., text summaries or comments) obtained from web pages, news articles, etc. Traditionally, to enable its exploitation, the textual information of items is represented by using basic information retrieval models (such as the vector space model), which do not take into account natural language challenges involving the semantics of the words (synonymy, polysemy and hiperonymy, etc.) or language understanding. Other solutions try to exploit those semantics. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation where we compare several recommendation approaches, including a content-based recommender based on vector space models, a deep learning and content-based recommendation approach, and a semantic-aware content-based recommendation model. This last approach exploits textual features of items obtained from the Linked Open Data (LOD) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for language modelling. Deep Learning transformers are achieving good results in different NLP (Natural Language Processing) problems, but using them to build content-based recommendation systems has not been explored in depth so far. Our experimental results, focused on the domain of movie recommendations, show that a approach based on the use of BERT can provide good results if enough training data are available.},

Since the information on the web is changing continuously and owing to the presence of a large number of similar web pages, it is very challenging to retrieve the most relevant information. With a large number of malicious and fake web pages, it is required to retrieve Web Pages that are trustworthy. Personalization of the recommendation of web pages is certainly necessary to estimate the user interests for suggesting web pages as per their choices. Moreover, the Web is tending towards a more organized Semantic Web which primarily requires semantic techniques for recommending the Web Pages. In this paper, a framework for personalized web page recommendation based on a hybridized strategy is proposed. Web Pages are recommended based on the user query by analyzing the Web Usage Data of the users. An array of strategies is intelligently integrated together to achieve an efficient Web Page Recommendation system. Latent Semantic Analysis is applied to the User-Term Matrix and the Term-Frequency Matrix that are built from the Web Usage Information to form a Term Prioritization Vector. Further, techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Topic-based Segregation of the URLs and Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information strategies are used for recommending web pages based on users' queries. The Personalization is achieved by prioritizing the Web pages based on the Prioritization Vector. Also, a unique methodology is incorporated into the system to retrieve trustworthy websites. An overall Accuracy of 0.84 is achieved which is better than the existing strategies.},

One of the most important issues in these systems is social relationships and the influence of individuals on each other in groups. In this article, a new method has been proposed to compute members' influence on each other based on similarity and trust. Normally in groups, there are some people called Leaders who are trusted more than other members and have a significant impact on the members. Therefore, this study has attempted to compute the leader's impact on the members' preferences. One remarkable aspect of this method is the use of a combination of fuzzy clustering and similarity measure to find users who have similar interests. Furthermore, an implicit trust metric has been formulated to improve the efficiency of the influence process and leader identification. Eventually, the proposed method which has been evaluated utilizing a MovieLens 100k dataset showed significant results by MAE, RMSE, Precision, and a group-satisfaction-measure compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, the proposed trust metric has shown better efficiency compared to some state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Trust evaluation is one of the most important issues in trust related research. How to evaluate the trust between two users is the main problem faced by many current recommendation systems and trust research. Currently in many applications, such as movie recommendation, spam detection, and online borrowing, evaluating trust among users in a trust social network (TSN) is a key issue. Therefore, this paper introduces the development process of trust evaluation in two aspects. The first is trust evaluation under different factors, such as user information and evidence. The second is trust evaluation based on different methods, such as neural networks and collaborative filtering methods. In the future, more factors can be combined with neural networks and reinforcement learning for trust assessment. For user privacy protection, blockchain technology can be combined to better encrypt user information, making the results more accurate and close to reality, and apply to more recommendation systems.},

abstract = {In cloud computing environment the problem of low recommendation accuracy caused by the influence of social noise is ignored in the existing social recommendation researches, we propose a novel approach to compute the trust values by using the asymmetry of trust network, which can mitigate the impact of social noise. At the same time the overall distribution information captured by different modeling schemes is significantly different when it exists a large amount of data in cloud services, and it affects the user's cold start, as that is not conducive to the personalized recommendation. We study the sparseness problem of the recommender systems, and report the research status of social recommendation. Accordingly we propose a noise-aware asymmetric social collective matrix factorization model called AsySocialCoMF to solve the problem above. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the recommendation accuracy by 2%-15% compared with the current works, and it also performs better for the user's cold start problem. It is worth noting that the approach is also applicable to other information retrieval scenarios.},

In order to achieve the goal of recommending relevant items, in addition to improving the accuracy of the recommendation algorithms, it is necessary to use user-centered approaches, so that SRs can inspire trust and loyalty, increasing users satisfaction, and convincing them to recommended item. One way to achieve these objectives is to explain the recommendations generated by these systems. An explanation starts from a communicative process between a sender and a receiver. Thus, in addition to user-centered approaches, it is also necessary to think of a communication-centered approach. In this work, we propose to explore and reflect, from a Semiotic Engineering perspective, on how the recommendation systems explanation process happens. Thus, we carried out an evaluation of the quality of the explanation given by Facebook regarding the advertising recommendations offered in the users timeline, based on the Semiotic Inspection Method and the application of a questionnaire.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent systems to help e-commerce users to find their preferred items among millions of available items by considering the profiles of both users and items. These systems need to predict the unknown ratings and then recommend a set of high rated items. Among the others, Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a successful recommendation approach and has been utilized in many real-world systems. CF methods seek to predict missing ratings by considering the preferences of those users who are similar to the target user. A major task in Collaborative Filtering is to identify an accurate set of users and employing them in the rating prediction process. Most of the CF-based methods suffer from the cold-start issue which arising from an insufficient number of ratings in the prediction process. This is due to the fact that users only comment on a few items and thus CF methods faced with a sparse user-item matrix. To tackle this issue, a new collaborative filtering method is proposed that has a trust-aware strategy. The proposed method employs the trust relationships of users as additional information to help the CF tackle the cold-start issue. To this end, the proposed integrated trust relationships in the prediction process by using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed method has four main steps. The aim of the first step is ranking users based on their similarities to the target user. This step uses trust relationships and the available rating values in its process. Then in the second step, graph clustering methods are used to cluster the trust graph to group similar users. In the third step, the users are weighted based on their similarities to the target users. To this end, an ACO process is employed on the users' graph. Finally, those of top users with high similarity to the target user are used in the rating prediction process. The superiority of our method has been shown in the experimental results in comparison with well-known and state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite the ubiquity of recommender systems in the digital world, only few researchers have attempted to explain their functioning, whereas it raises e.g., ethical issues. Indeed, recommender systems direct user choices to a large extent and their impact is important as they give access to only a small part of the range of items (e.g., products and/or services), as the submerged part of the iceberg. Consequently, they limit access to other resources. The potentially negative effects of these systems have been pointed out as phenomena like echo chambers and winner-take-all effects, because the internal logic of these systems is to likely enclose the consumer in a "dej a vu"loop. Therefore, it is crucial to provide explanations' of such recommender systems and to identify the user data that led the system to make a specific recommendation. This makes it possible to evaluate recommender systems not only regarding their efficiency (i.e., their capability to recommend an item that was actually chosen by the user), but also w.r.t. the diversity, relevance and timeliness of the active data used to make the recommendation. In this paper, we propose a deep analysis of 7 state-of-the-art models learnt on 6 datasets based on the identification of the items or the sequences of items actively used by the models. The proposed method, which is based on subgroup discovery with different pattern languages (i.e., itemsets and sequences), provides interpretable explanations of the recommendations - useful to compare different models and explain the reasons behind the recommendation to the user.},

abstract = {—Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most frequently used recommendation techniques to design recommender systems that improve accuracy in terms of recommendation, coverage, and rating prediction. Although CF is a well-established and popular algorithm, it suffers with issues like black-box recommendation, data sparsity, cold-start, and limited content problems that hamper its performance. Moreover, CF is fragile and it is not suitable to find similar users. The existing literatures on CF show that integrating users' social information with a recommender system can handle the above-mentioned issues effectively. Recently, trustworthiness among users is considered as one such social information that has been successfully combined with CF to predict ratings of the unrated items. In this paper, we propose a trust-based recommender system, TrustRER, which integrates users' trusts into an existing user-based CF algorithm for rating prediction. It uses both ratings and textual information of the items to generate a trust network for users and derives the trust scores. For trust score, we have defined three novel trust statements based on user rating values, emotion values, and review helpfulness votes. To generate a trust network, we have used trust propagation metrics to compute trust scores between those users who are not directly connected. The proposed TrustRER is experimentally evaluated over three datasets related to movie, music, and hotel and restaurant domains, and it performs significantly better in comparison to nine standard baselines and one state-of-the-art recommendation method. TrustRER is also able to effectively deal with the cold-start problem because it improves the rating prediction accuracy for cold-start users in comparison to baselines and state-of-the-art method.},

On social media, users' ratings and reviews can be observed by all users, and have implicit influence on their future ratings. When these users make subsequent decisions about an item, they may be affected by existing ratings on the item. Thus, implicit influence propagates among the users who rated the same items, and it has significant impact on users' ratings. However, implicit influence propagation and its effect on recommendation rarely have been studied. In this article, we propose an information propagation-based social recommendation method (SoInp) and model the implicit user influence from the perspective of information propagation. The implicit influence is inferred from ratings on the same items. We investigate the concrete effect of implicit user influence in the propagation process and introduce it into recommender systems. Furthermore, we incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit trust information in the matrix factorization framework. To demonstrate the performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that SoInp makes notable improvements in rating prediction.},

Most of the existing GRS obtain group preferences using equal weighing of the individual preferences, ignoring the relationship among group members within the group. But this is not a practical scenario because each member has different behavior. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a multiagent based negotiation mechanism between agents, each of them acts in favor of one group member. The proposed negotiation protocol allows agents to accept or discard a part of the offer based on trust and distrust among users, which gives more agility to the negotiation process. Further, we use memory for each agent in the group that records the previously proposed offers for that agent. The efficiency of trust-distrust enhanced GRSs is compared with traditional techniques and the outcomes of computational experiments confirm the supremacy of our proposed models over baseline GRSs techniques.},

It may draw a penetrative path to mitigate the environmental effects that utilize the natural resource to manage the intelligent infrastructure and services. Moreover, the sustainable development process plays a crucial role to catalyze IoT and big-data application that connects the economic growth with the quality of smart cities. The IoT-enabled big-data applications choose a suitable thematic analysis to direct the use of recommendation systems.

Based on this intuition in this framework, the architecture of community-based trust aware recommender systems (CB-TARS) is proposed. Users' preferences are expressed by incorporating trusted neighbors within the community of the target user are merged in order to find similar preferences. In addition, the worth of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings inside the community and the percentage of clashes between negative and positive views. Further, rating confidence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for an unrated item is computed by aggregating the ratings of similar users within the community. Experimental results on real-world data set validate that the proposed method surpasses other complements in terms of accuracy.},

abstract = {When users in online social networks make a decision, they are often affected by their neighbors. Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models. Our method is quite general, and indicates that studies in social physics, statistics, and other research fields may be involved in recommendation to improve the performance.},

We have introduced a unique recommendation approach in our conference paper, called Confidence-aware Trust (CAT), which considers a confidence estimate in both direct and indirect trust calculations. However, the CAT recommendation approach does not involve some vital aspects, namely: the number of neighbors of active users/target items, consistency in rating values, and the level of confidence in the predicted rating value as well.

The fact that streaming music platforms have some social functionalities also allows this type of information to be used for music recommendation. In this work, we take advantage of the friendship structure to address a type of recommendation bias derived from the way collaborative filtering methods compute the neighborhood. These methods restrict the rating predictions for a user to the items that have been rated by their nearest neighbors while leaving out other items that might be of his/her interest. This problem is different from the popularity bias caused by the power-law distribution of the item rating frequency (long-tail), well-known in the music domain, although both shortcomings can be related.

We applied a clustering method, Fuzzy Formal Concepts Analysis, to model agent and evaluate its trust and a probabilistic method, Theory of Belief Functions, to predict the expert agent.},

abstract = {Many online retailers, such as Amazon, use automated product recommender systems to encourage customer loyalty and cross-sell products. Despite significant improvements to the predictive accuracy of contemporary recommender system algorithms, they remain prone to errors. Erroneous recommendations pose potential threats to online retailers in particular, because they diminish customers' trust in, acceptance of, satisfaction with, and loyalty to a recommender system. Explanations of the reasoning that lead to recommendations might mitigate these negative effects. That is, a recommendation algorithm ideally would provide both accurate recommendations and explanations of the reasoning for those recommendations. This article proposes a novel method to balance these concurrent objectives. The application of this method, using a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering, to two real-world data sets with more than 100 million product ratings reveals that the proposed method outperforms established recommender approaches in terms of predictive accuracy (more than five percent better than the Netflix Prize winner algorithm according to normalized root mean squared error) and its ability to provide actionable explanations, which is also an ethical requirement of artificial intelligence systems.},

Within ICT, recommender systems are strong tools that filter relevant information, upgrading the relations between stakeholders in the polity and civil society, and assisting in decision making tasks through technological platforms. There are scientific articles covering recommendation approaches in smart city applications, and there are recommendation solutions implemented in real world smart city initiatives. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive review of the state of the art on recommender systems for smart cities. For this reason, in this paper we present a taxonomy of smart city features, dimensions, actions and goals, and, according to these variables, we survey the existing literature on recommender systems. As a result of our survey, we do not only identify and analyze main research trends, but also show current opportunities and challenges where personalized recommendations could be exploited as solutions for citizens, firms and public administrations.},

abstract = {With the increase of online commodity transaction volume and the further development of social network, recommendation system has become one of important tools to solve information overload. However, when the data sparsity of the score matrix is relatively large, the recommendation accuracy will decrease significantly, especially when the user starts cold. A new social ranking recommendation algorithm based on implicit feedback information was proposed in this paper. The user preferences among different items using a matrix factorization method were first calculated by the proposed algorithm. Secondly, the user preference information was incorporated into the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) algorithm. Then, the similar relationships between users as well as direct and indirect relationships between trusting users were mined and quantified in order to study the differences of user preferences across projects. Finally, these trust relationships were fused with the BPR algorithm to build a social ranking recommendation model. To validate the proposed social ranking recommendation algorithm, the validity of the algorithm was verified on the DouBan dataset and FilmTrust dataset. The ranking evaluation metrics of Precision, MAP, and NGCD were used to verify the merits of ranking recommendation between the proposed algorithm and SBPR, TBPR, BPR, and MostPopular algorithms. The ranking recommendation tests were performed on these two specific social datasets for the full dataset and user cold start, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other ranking recommendation algorithms and achieves better recommendation accuracy. It can be seen that the algorithm can improve the poor recommendation performance caused by data sparsity and user cold start.},

One of the widely adopted frameworks is the user-based collaborative filtering, where the explicit POI rating is calculated based on similar users' preference. However, the trust between users is seldom considered. We believe that if two users show similar preferences or personality traits, the trust level between them should be high. To this end, we propose to calculate the trust-enhanced user similarity in user-based collaborative filtering based on network representation learning. Meanwhile, due to the significance of geographic influence and temporal influence, we integrate these two factors into POI recommendation by a fusion model. Therefore, our proposed POI recommendation system is unified collaborative recommendation framework, which fuses trust-enhanced users' preferences to potential POIs with geographic influences and temporal influence for POI recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision@k and recall@k. Experimental results indicate that our proposed trust-enhanced collaborative filtering method outperforms other recommendation approaches.},

The proliferation of social platforms has generated massive amounts of data and a considerable number of persons join these platforms every day. Therefore, one of the current issues is to facilitate the search for the most appropriate friends for a given user. We focus in this article on the recommendation of users in social networks. We propose a novel approach which combines a user-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm with semantic and social recommendations. The semantic dimension suggests the close friends based on the calculation of the similarity between the active user and his friends. The social dimension is based on some social-behavior metrics such as friendship and credibility degree. The novelty of our approach concerns the modeling of the credibility of the user, through his/her trust and commitment in the social network. A social recommender system based on this approach is developed and experiments have been conducted using the Yelp social network. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid approach improves the accuracy of the recommendation compared with the user-based CF algorithm and solves the sparsity and cold start problems.},

Therefore, one of the key issues in today's world is the extraction of knowledge from a large database. The recommendation systems are able to extract useful information from large databases. The information extracted by the recommendation systems may breach the privacy-preserving of individuals and increase the error rate. Concerns will grow along with the increasing privacy breaches, which are done by recommendation systems. In recent years, researchers have provided a variety of techniques for privacy-preserving and reduced error rates in recommendation systems. But most of these methods have not offered good solutions for privacy-preserving issues and reducing error rates. The aim of the proposed method is to provide a solution for users' security concerns in common filtering systems with reduced error rates and more privacy preservation. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving method for recommendation systems called PRS, which first uses an anonymous method to convert secondary data without user identification information. The existing trust data are measured in terms of resemblance and trust-weighted criterion and then converted from perturbation-based chaos to confidential data. Finally, these two algorithms have been used for clustering the data: fuzzy c-ordered means and particle swarm optimization. The results of experiments have been compared with state-of-the-art methods, which show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of classification error rates and privacy-preserving.},

abstract = {Although algorithms have been widely used to deliver useful applications and services, it is unclear how users actually experience and interact with algorithm-driven services. This ambiguity is even more troubling in news recommendation algorithms, where thorny issues are complicated. This study investigates the user experience and usability of algorithms by focusing on users' cognitive process to understand how qualities/features are received and transformed into experiences and interaction. This work examines how users perceive and feel about issues in news recommendations and how they interact and engage with algorithm-recommended news. It proposes an algorithm experience model of news recommendation integrating the heuristic process of cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors. The underlying algorithm can affect in different ways the user's perception and trust of the system. The heuristic affect occurs when users' subjective feelings about transparency and accuracy act as a mental shortcut: users considered transparent and accurate systems convenient and useful. The mediating role of trust suggests that establishing algorithmic trust between users and NRS could enhance algorithm performance. The model illustrates the users' cognitive processes of perceptual judgment as well as the motivation behind user behaviors. The results highlight a link between news recommendation systems and user interaction, providing a clearer conceptualization of user-centered development and the evaluation of algorithm-based services.},

abstract = {Intelligence is the ability to learn from experience and use domain experts' knowledge to adapt to new situations. In this context, an intelligent Recommender System should be able to learn from domain experts' knowledge and experience, as it is vital to know the domain that the items will be recommended. Traditionally, Recommender Systems have been recognized as playlist generators for video/music services (e.g., Netflix and Spotify), e-commerce product recommenders (e.g., Amazon and eBay), or social content recommenders (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). However, Recommender Systems in modern enterprises are highly data-/knowledge-driven and may rely on users' cognitive aspects such as personality, behavior, and attitude. In this paper, we survey and summarize previously published studies on Recommender Systems to help readers understand our method's contributions to the field in this context. We discuss the current limitations of the state of the art approaches in Recommender Systems and the need for our new approach: a vision and a general framework for a new type of data-driven, knowledge-driven, and cognition-driven Recommender Systems, namely, Cognitive Recommender Systems. Cognitive Recommender Systems will be the new type of intelligent Recommender Systems that understand the user's preferences, detect changes in user preferences over time, predict user's unknown favorites, and explore adaptive mechanisms to enable intelligent actions within the compound and changing environments. We present a motivating scenario in banking and argue that existing Recommender Systems: (i) do not use domain experts' knowledge to adapt to new situations; (ii) may not be able to predict the ratings or preferences a customer would give to a product (e.g., loan, deposit, or trust service); and (iii) do not support data capture and analytics around customers' cognitive activities and use it to provide intelligent and time-aware recommendations.},

abstract = {Recommender systems can improve the quality of life in smart cities by presenting personalized services to the community. Such systems maintain a database of user profiles for producing recommendations for a specific user. The collaborative filtering (CF) approach used in these systems has become a benchmark approach for generating recommendations for interested users because it can provide “out of the box” solutions. These CF-based approaches first construct a user–item rating matrix and then exploit similarity methods. These approaches suffer from scalability, sparsity, and cold user conditions, which consequently result in the poor recommendation accuracy of these systems. To enhance the accuracy of recommender systems, social trust can play a vital role because people tend to interact with a system or respond positively to recommendations that originate from their social trustworthy friends. The proposed unified approach of this article uses explicit trust, implicit trust, and user preference similarity to create a unified rating profile for the target user to produce more powerful and accurate recommendations. The proposed unified approach also enhances the recommendation performance of CF-based recommender systems when only a limited set of ratings is available. Experiments are performed on three publicly available datasets which are FilmTrust, CiaoDVD, and Epinions. Comparison of obtained results is made with traditional similarity measures as well as up-to-date trust-based approaches. The results show that the proposed unified approach is superior to existing approaches in terms of both predictive and classification-based accuracy measures.},

Recommender Systems are a class of AI techniques that extract preference patterns from large traces of human behavior. Recommenders assist people in taking decisions that range from harmless everyday life dilemmas, e.g., what shoes to buy, to seemingly innocuous choices but with long-term, hidden consequences, e.g., what news article to read, up to more critical decisions, e.g., which person to hire. As more and more aspects of our everyday lives are influenced by automated decisions made by recommender systems, it becomes natural to question whether these systems are trustworthy, particularly given the opaqueness and complexity of their internal workings. These questions are timely posed in the broader context of concerns regarding the societal and ethical implications of applying AI techniques, which have also brought about new regulations, like the EU's "Right to Explanation". In this talk, we discuss techniques for increasing the user's trust in the decisions of a recommender system, focusing on fairness aspects and explanation approaches. On the one hand, fairness means that the system exhibits certain desirable ethical traits, such as being non-discriminatory, diversity-aware, and bias-free. On the other hand, explanations provide human-understandable interpretations of the inner working of the system. Both mechanisms can be used in tandem to promote trust in the system. In addition, we investigate user trust from the standpoint of different stakeholders that potentially have varying levels of technical background and diverse needs.},

abstract = {The collaborative filtering technology used in traditional recommendation systems has a problem of data sparsity. The traditional matrix decomposition algorithm simply decomposes users and items into a linear model of potential factors. These limitations have led to the low accuracy in traditional recommendation algorithms, thus leading to the emergence of recommendation systems based on deep learning. At present, deep learning recommendations mostly use deep neural networks to model some of the auxiliary information, and in the process of modeling, multiple mapping paths are adopted to map the original input data to the potential vector space. However, these deep neural network recommendation algorithms ignore the combined effects of different categories of data, which can have a potential impact on the effectiveness of the recommendation. Aimed at this problem, in this paper we propose a feedforward deep neural network recommendation method, called the deep association neural network (DAN), which is based on the joint action of multiple categories of information, for implicit feedback recommendation. Specifically, the underlying input of the model includes not only users and items, but also more auxiliary information. In addition, the impact of the joint action of different types of information on the recommendation is considered. Experiments on an open data set show the significant improvements made by our proposed method over the other methods. Empirical evidence shows that deep, joint recommendations can provide better recommendation performance.},

Furthermore, it is still unclear whether this cognitive style also affects the interaction strategies of users, and whether the reason why and when users want transparency is affected by this cognitive style. Additionally, despite the ubiquitous presence of recommender systems on mobile environments, no study has investigated the effect of transparency for mobile music recommender systems. In this paper, we report the results of a within-subject study (N=25) on a mobile music recommender system where we investigated the effect of cognitive styles on three different aspects: the interaction strategies with the different applications, the reasons why and when users want transparency and the effect of transparency on the trust of users. The results show that users with a rational thinking style put more effort in seeking the best recommendations and that they want scrutable explanations to adjust the recommendation. In contrast, intuitive thinkers only need explanations when they search for a very specific kind of music.},

abstract = {The web contains a huge volume of data, and it's populating every moment to the point that human beings cannot deal with the vast amount of data manually or via traditional tools. Hence an advanced tool is required to filter such massive data and mine the valuable information. Recommender systems are among the most excellent tools for such a purpose in which collaborative filtering is widely used. Collaborative filtering (CF) has been extensively utilized to offer personalized recommendations in electronic business and social network websites. In that, matrix factorization is an efficient technique; however, it depends on past transactions of the users. Hence, there will be a data sparsity problem. Another issue with the collaborative filtering method is the cold start issue, which is due to the deficient information about new entities. A novel method is proposed to overcome the data sparsity and the cold start problem in CF. For cold start issue, Recommender System with Linked Open Data (RS-LOD) model is designed and for data sparsity problem, Matrix Factorization model with Linked Open Data is developed (MF-LOD). A LOD knowledge base “DBpedia” is used to find enough information about new entities for a cold start issue, and an improvement is made on the matrix factorization model to handle data sparsity. Experiments were done on Netflix and MovieLens datasets show that our proposed techniques are superior to other existing methods, which mean recommendation accuracy is improved.},

abstract = {The integration of trust system and recommendation system is a new hot spot in current research. Trust relationship has be exploited in social recommendation, which can effectively solve the problems of low recommendation quality, sparse data and cold start in the traditional recommendation system. Meanwhile, trust inference in social relations is necessary in completing trust information and expanding social recommendation knowledge base. In this work, we propose a new trust inference algorithm LWCTrust to improve the efficiency and accuracy of social recommendation. Firstly, we construct a local weighted centrality (LWC) metric based on the user's degree centrality and trust information, and propose a new adaptive breadth-first search algorithm. Then, based on the property of path decay, we compare two different trust decay strategies. In addition, considering inconsistencies and conflicts in trust opinion, we apply LWC metric to multi-path aggregation step and present a OWA dynamic aggregation strategy. A number of experiments are conducted on the real social network dataset Advogato, and the results validate the great performance of LWCTrust. Our work is the first to construct an efficient LWC metric using social graph trust information, and we explore the effect of attenuation functions on accuracy in path propagation.},

Some of these language versions can provide very different but valuable information on each topic. Measuring the quality of articles using metrics is intended to make open data pages such as Wikipedia more reliable and trustworthy. A major challenge is that the 'gold standard' in determining the quality of an open data page is unknown. Therefore, we investigated which factors influence the potentials of quality determination of collaborative open data pages and their sources. Our model is based on empirical data derived from the experience of international experts on knowledge management and data quality. It has been developed by using semi-structured interviews and a qualitative content analysis based on Grounded Theory (GT).

As a result, we face a new generation of e-commerce called Social Commerce. On the other hand, in the tourism industry, a variety of services and products are provided. The dramatic rise in the number of options in travel packages, hotels, tourist attractions, etc. put users in a difficult situation to find what they need. For a reason, tourism recommender systems have been considered by researchers and businesses as a solution. Since tourist attractions are often the reason for travelling, this research proposes a social-hybrid recommender system in the context of social commerce that recommends tourist attractions. The purpose of the research is presenting a personalized list of tourist attractions for each tourist based on the similarity of users' desires and interests, trust, reputation, relationships, and social communities. Compared with the traditional methods, collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid, the advantage of the proposed method is the use of various factors and the inclusion of trust factors in recommendation resources, (such as outlier detection in user ratings), and employing social relationships among individuals. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over other common methods. The proposed method can also be used to recommend other products and services in the tourism industry and other social commerce.},

abstract = {Social big data is large scale of data due to exponential popularity of social network and social media. Researchers can use social big data and social network for their observations if they analyse those in an intelligent manner. The target of intelligent decision is to find the most credible user in social network, who has the highest influence. A very large number of users are connected in social networks, implicitly friends-of-friends or explicitly mutual friends. They are able to communicate with each other and share their likes or dislikes on different topics. If users want to analyse any topic or purchase product like movie, book, they are populated with a lot of choices. Information overload due to large number of choices available to users limits effective product selection and hence results in reduced users' satisfaction. Recommendation models are solution for providing better suggestion to users. Product's recommendation at Amazon, friend's recommendation at Facebook and music recommendation at iTunes are some of the popular examples of suggestions made on the basis of user's interests. Recommendation models ease the user by reducing search space in social network graph. The main purpose of this paper is to improve social recommendations so that better and more appropriate choices are available for users. In this paper, an efficient technique for social recommendations using hyperedge and transitive closure is proposed. Social big data is processed and analysed in the form of social graphs. User–user and user–item connections are represented in the form of matrices. We have exploited homophily so that large number of connected users have trust on each other. Our model provides better recommendation to users by leveraging increased trust. The proposed model overcomes the limitations of traditional recommender systems like sparsity, cold start. It also improves prediction accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated through different metrics like MAE, precision, recall and RMSE. Empirical analysis shows significant improvement in recommendations. We have used Mahout library for improving recommendation accuracy and also handling large volume of data. SNAP library is also used for analysis of social big graphs. The proposed recommendation model is evaluated using Epinions and FilmTrust datasets. These datasets contain user's ratings for various products in the scale of 1–5. Through analysis it is verified that the proposed model boosts the performance significantly. We have formulated recommendation model using manipulated social graph as per our proposed technique. This manipulated graph is mentioned as influence product graph (IPG) throughout this paper. IPG increases social trust value between connected users and this effect in recommending products in an effective and efficient manner.},

abstract = {Trust recommendation system is an important application of recommendation system based on social network. It combines the trust relationship between users to recommend items to users. However, previous studies generally assume that the trust value between users is fixed, so it is unable to respond to the dynamic changes of user trust and preferences in a timely manner, thus affecting the recommendation effect. In fact, after receiving the recommendation, there is a difference between actual evaluation and expected evaluation which is correlated with trust value. The user's trust in the recommender will increase when the actual evaluation is higher than expected evaluation, and vice versa. Based on the dynamics of trust and the changing process of trust between users, this paper proposes a trust boost method through reinforcement learning. Least mean square algorithm is used to learn the dynamic impact of evaluation difference on user's trust. In addition, a reinforcement learning method deep q -learning (DQN) is studied to simulate the process of learning user's preferences and boosting trust value. Finally, a polynomial level algorithm is proposed to calculate the trust value and recommendation, which can motivate the recommender to learn the user's preference and keep the user's trust in the recommender at a high level. Experiments indicate that our method applied to recommendation systems could respond to the changes quickly on user's preferences. Compared with other methods, our method has better accuracy on recommendation.},

abstract = {In many recommender systems, users express item opinions through two kinds of behaviors: giving preferences and writing detailed reviews. As both kinds of behaviors reflect users' assessment of items, review enhanced recommender systems leverage these two kinds of user behaviors to boost recommendation performance. On the one hand, researchers proposed to better model the user and item embeddings with additional review information for enhancing preference prediction accuracy. On the other hand, some recent works focused on automatically generating item reviews for recommendation explanations with related user and item embeddings. We argue that, while the task of preference prediction with the accuracy goal is well recognized in the community, the task of generating reviews for explainable recommendation is also important to gain user trust and increase conversion rate. Some preliminary attempts have considered jointly modeling these two tasks, with the user and item embeddings are shared. These studies empirically showed that these two tasks are correlated, and jointly modeling them would benefit the performance of both tasks. In this paper, we make a further study of unifying these two tasks for explainable recommendation. Instead of simply correlating these two tasks with shared user and item embeddings, we argue that these two tasks are presented in dual forms. In other words, the input of the primal preference prediction task is exactly the output of the dual review generation task , with and denote the preference value space and review space. Therefore, we could explicitly model the probabilistic correlation between these two dual tasks with . We design a unified dual framework of how to inject the probabilistic duality of the two tasks in the training stage. Furthermore, as the detailed preference and review information are not available for each user-item pair in the test stage, we propose a transfer learning based model for preference prediction and review generation. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for both user preference prediction and review generation.},

It plays a critical role in a wide rang of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommendation systems, but it suffers from cold start problem where no rating data is available for new users or items in the system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve cold start problem for new users. The approach is named Leaders Advice Model(LAM). We use it to finish recommendation task. In our approach, we don't make use of private data sources of users, because it is difficult to get and involved in legal problem. Firstly, we use CF approach to generate candidate leaders. Secondly, to identify these candidate leaders, we need to train them. Then, when one new user enters the system, we can interview the user to get his/her interesting trend. Finally, according to new user's interesting trend, our approach can recommend corresponding items to the new user. Some experiments on a MovieLens rating data set of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation approach can improve the cold start problem for new users. The design can be applied to many other recommendation systems for online shopping and social networking applications.

By this mechanism, the system is able to imitate natural conversation between customer and professional sales support, for eliciting customer preference.

A more natural way to explore customer preferences is by asking what they want to use with the product they are looking for (product functional requirements). Therefore, this paper proposes a computational model incorporating product functional requirements for interaction. The proposed model covers ontology and its structure as well as algorithms for generating interaction that comprises asking question, recommending products and presenting explanation of why a product is recommended. Based on our user studies, both expert users (familiar with product technical features) and novice users (not familiar with product technical feature) prefer our proposed interaction model than that of the flat interaction model (interaction model based on technical features). Meanwhile, functional requirements-based explanation is able to improve user trust in recommended products by 30% for novice users and 17% for expert users.},

abstract = {Today, the trust has turned into one of the most beneficial solutions to improve recommender systems, especially in the collaborative filtering methods. However, trust statements suffer from a number of shortcomings, including the trust statements sparsity, users' inability to express explicit trust for other users in most of the existing applications. To overcome these problems, this work presents a method for computing implicit trust based on user ratings, in which four influential factors including Similarity, Confidence, Analogous Opinion, and Distance are utilized to achieve trust. For computing users' similarity, Person Correlation Coefficient measure was applied. Confidence was computed through users' common in rated items. To compute users' analogous opinions, their ratings were evaluated from three aspects of their satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and indifference about the items. Euclidean distance was employed on users ratings for computing the distance. Finally, the factors were combined to reach the implicit trust. Moreover, fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to initially partition similar users for enhancing the performance positively. Finally, two MovieLens datasets of 100K and 1M have been used to evaluate this approach, and results have shown that the approach significantly increases Accuracy, Precision and Recall, compared to some other existing methods.},

abstract = {Recommender systems face multiple challenges like cold-start, sparsity, first-rater and scalability. This study proposes an ontology based framework which can resolve these challenges simultaneously. The Ontology is prepared using prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} and visualized online using Graphical Ontology Editor OWLGrEd.Ontology is trust based where degree of trust is the ratings given by users. The framework is used for technical course recommendation. To eliminate cold start, user will be provided a form with top ‘k' factors. These top “k” factors are the significant factors obtained as a result of partial correlation analysis. The selection criterion was level of significance <0.05.The recommendation will be done on the basis of the ratings user provides to these “k” factors. Sparsity and First-rater is handled by using the Knowledge of trust from the knowledge base made from trust base ontology and provides the recommendation. The proposed framework is scalable and is implemented using offline forms. The precision rate of the proposed system is more than 95% for 3 algorithms out of total 6 implemented algorithms. The only limitation of the proposed framework is that it is domain specific because it is based on ontology.},

Primarily, this is of wide-ranging importance due to the huge involvement of all sorts of transactions. Use of recommendation systems (RSs) in aid of e-commerce will not only increase the profit, but also render in the conversion of browsers to buyers and enhance the loyalty of a user. In this paper, we discuss various hybrid social RSs that make use of several social factors. In addition, we use Thomas-Kilmann conflict mode instrument (TKI) test and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to show their efficiency in the RSs. There is always a quest to involve maximum social information to enhance the recommendations about a given product. Therefore, this paper inculcates maximum social factors, namely the distance between the individuals, similarity in the recommendations made, trust and relationships to improve the accuracy of the recommendations. We discuss a proposal on a hybrid social RS, which uses TKI test and AHP. It is observed that there is a huge involvement of intimacy and intensity with respect to trust and relationship in order to make the recommendations.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are recently becoming more significant in the age of rapid development of Internet technology and pervasive computing due to their ability in making appropriate choices to users. Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful recommendation techniques, which recommends items to an active user based on past ratings from like-minded users. However, the user-item rating matrix, namely one of the inputs to the recommendation algorithm, is often highly sparse, thus collaborative filtering may lead to the poor recommendation. To solve this problem, social networks can be employed to improve the accuracy of recommendations. Some of the social factors have been used in recommender system, but have not been fully considered. In this paper, we fuse personal cognition behavior, cognition relationships between users, and time decay factor for rated items into a unified probabilistic matrix factorization model and propose an enhanced social matrix factorization approach for personalized recommendation using social interaction factors. In this study, we integrate propagation enhancement, common user relationship enhancement, and common interest enhancement into social relationship between users, and propose a novel trust relationship calculation to alleviate the negative impact of sparsity of data rating. The proposed model is compared with the existing social recommendation algorithms on real world datasets including the Epinions and Movielens datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance to the other recommendation algorithms.},

In recent years, various thread-based and trust based approaches have been proposed, which improve the precision and recall of recommendation to certain extent. However, these approaches are less accurate than expected when users' preferences evolve over time and when several aspects of the users are involved. To solve these problems, we propose a novel recommendation method called, Soft Cosine Gradient and Gaussian Joint Probability (SCG-GJP) for Online Social Networks (OSN). Specifically, the Local Soft Cosine Clique Clustering (LSCCC) is first used to identify good candidate items to be recommended. Second, using adjacency matrix factorization, probable past preference of individual user and overall preference of whole community is formed to reduce the problem of mean absolute error. Again, the obtained matrix is trained through the stochastic function gradient to rank the most suitable candidates. Finally, Gaussian Mixture Joint Probability Postfiltering model is proposed to provide useful recommendations. The experiments are executed with real-world dataset (DS) and compared with the conventional recommendation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the SCGGJP obtains higher accuracy, and lesser error as well as complexity.},

abstract = {There are two key characteristics of users in trust relationships that have been well studied: (1) users trust their friends with different trust strengths and (2) users play multiple roles of trusters and trustees in trust relationships. However, few studies have considered both of these factors. Indeed, it is quite common for someone to respond to his/her friend that they trusted him/her, which indicates that there exist two kinds of information between each pair of users: the trust influence of trustee on truster and the feedback influence of truster on trustee. Considering this problem, we propose a novel adaptive method to learn the trust influence between users with multiple roles of truster and trustee for recommendation. First, we propose to introduce the concept of latent trust strength to learn adaptive role-based trust strength with limited values for each trust relationship between users. Second, because there is only one training example to learn each parameter of latent trust strength, we further propose two regularization methods by building relations between latent trust strength and user preferences to guide the training process of latent trust strength. After that, we develop a new recommendation method, RoleTS, by integrating the role-based trust strength into a previous recommendation model, TrustSVD, which considers both explicit and implicit information of trust and ratings. We also conduct a series of experiments to study the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results on two public real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In order to address this issue, we extend trust-based recommender systems with additional evidence about trust, based on public anonymous information, and we make them configurable with respect to the data that can be used in the given application domain: 1. We propose the Multi-faceted Trust Model (MTM) to define trust among users in a compositional way, possibly including or excluding the types of information it contains. MTM flexibly integrates social links with public anonymous feedback received by user profiles and user contributions in social networks. 2. We propose LOCABAL+, based on MTM, which extends the LOCABAL trust-based recommender system with multi-faceted trust and trust-based social regularization. Experiments carried out on two public datasets of item reviews show that, with a minor loss of user coverage, LOCABAL+ outperforms state-of-the art trust-based recommender systems and Collaborative Filtering in accuracy, ranking of items and error minimization both when it uses complete information about trust and when it ignores social relations. The combination of MTM with LOCABAL+ thus represents a promising alternative to state-of-the-art trust-based recommender systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems learn users' preferences from their explicit feedback, such as ratings, and implicit feedback, such as purchases. Learning a user's preference from implicit feedback is difficult since inaction in such data can be because of either dislike for an item or unawareness. Exposure modeling has been proposed recently to address this ambiguity by decomposing inaction into dislike and unawareness. A user's awareness of items can be affected by several factors, and exposure modeling has been extended to include social and temporal influences on exposure to provide better recommendations. However, recommendation itself should also affect a user's awareness of items. Recommendations boost awareness differently for different users; while some users are attentive to and trust recommendations, others neglect or distrust recommendations. Furthermore, if a user purchases an item from a recommendation list, the user would have likely noticed other items on the same list. In this paper, we extend exposure modeling by considering the influence of recommendations on exposure. We accomplish this by incorporating: (1) user-dependent increase in awareness of recommended items and (2) indirect increase in awareness of an item by the purchase of other items from the same recommendation list. Through experiments using public datasets with recommendation logs, we demonstrate that considering recommendation influence improves purchase prediction.},

In this work, we take a fresh perspective, and present Prince: a provider-side mechanism to produce tangible explanations for end-users, where an explanation is defined to be a set of minimal actions performed by the user that, if removed, changes the recommendation to a different item. Given a recommendation, Prince uses a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for finding this minimal set of a user's actions from an exponential search space, based on random walks over dynamic graphs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Prince provides more compact explanations than intuitive baselines, and insights from a crowdsourced user-study demonstrate the viability of such action-based explanations. We thus posit that Prince produces scrutable, actionable, and concise explanations, owing to its use of counterfactual evidence, a user's own actions, and minimal sets, respectively.},

Given the rapid Web evolution to a true melting pot of human activity, trust plays a central role since there is a massive number of parties interested in interacting in a multitude of ways but have little or even no reason to trust a priori each other. This has led to schemes for evaluating Web trust in contexts such as e-commerce, social media, recommender systems, and e-banking. Of particular interest in social networks are classification methods relying on network-dependent attributes pertaining to the past online behavior of an account. Since the deployment of such methods takes place at Internet scale, it makes perfect sense to rely on distributed processing platforms like Apache Spark. An added benefit of distributed platforms is paving the way algorithmically and computationally for higher order Web trust metrics. Here a Web trust classifier in MLlib, the machine learning library for Apache Spark, is presented. It relies on both the account activity but also on that of similar accounts. Three datasets obtained from topic sampling regarding trending Twitter topics serve as benchmarks. Based on the experimental results best practice recommendations are given.},

For an RS that we prove empirically is effective, we show how argumentative abstractions underpinning recommendations can provide the structural scaffolding for (different types of) interactive explanations (IEs), i.e. explanations supporting interactions with users. We prove formally that these IEs empower feedback mechanisms that guarantee that recommendations will improve with time, hence rendering the RS scrutable. Finally, we prove experimentally that the various forms of IE (tabular, textual and conversational) induce trust in the recommendations and provide a high degree of transparency in the RS's functionality.},

abstract = {The utility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare strongly depends upon the quality of the data used to build models, and the confidence in the predictions they generate. Access to sufficient amounts of high-quality data to build accurate and reliable models remains problematic owing to substantive legal and ethical constraints in making clinically relevant research data available offsite. New technologies such as distributed learning offer a pathway forward, but unfortunately tend to suffer from a lack of transparency, which undermines trust in what data are used for the analysis. To address such issues, we hypothesized that, a novel distributed learning that combines sequential distributed learning with a blockchain-based platform, namely Chained Distributed Machine learning C-DistriM, would be feasible and would give a similar result as a standard centralized approach. C-DistriM enables health centers to dynamically participate in training distributed learning models. We demonstrate C-DistriM using the NSCLC-Radiomics open data to predict two-year lung-cancer survival. A comparison of the performance of this distributed solution, evaluated in six different scenarios, and the centralized approach, showed no statistically significant difference (AUCs between central and distributed models), all DeLong tests yielded p-val > 0.05. This methodology removes the need to blindly trust the computation in one specific server on a distributed learning network. This fusion of blockchain and distributed learning serves as a proof-of-concept to increase transparency, trust, and ultimately accelerate the adoption of AI in multicentric studies. We conclude that our blockchain-based model for sequential training on distributed datasets is a feasible approach, provides equivalent performance to the centralized approach.},

abstract = {In this new era of technology there are lots of innovative revolutions going on around the world, among which some of the major fields are Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cognitive systems. Whereas, the combination of these three technologies can lead a way to the development of a new technology with high capacity and high potential. IoT is mainly sensors and actuators which are connected via internet where the objects can interact and communicate. It could make the device to act smart by yielding useful information from the gathered raw data which can be monitored and controlled remotely. Blockchain consist of data from various sources and locations called as blocks. Blockchain is mainly a tamper resistant distributed ledger in which all the transactions of the blocks are being recorded along with timestamp. Blockchain is also a decentralized network with properties including anonymity and integrity, which have the capacity to give security to the data transferred over Internet of things. Cognitive system repeatedly learns by interacting with the environment, situations, people and gathered data. It also improves its capability via learning and understanding the way of thinking ability of the human and tries to use those in the machine thus generating a way to produce a recommendation system to the user. In this paper, combinations of above three technologies are analyzed and a framework for cognitive IoT based on blockchain is proposed to design a recommender system. A trust-based recommender system is built to make a detailed review on the applicability of proposed system, where trust is the key in decision making process. Comparison is made between our proposed recommender system with the existing recommender system. The proposed recommender system gives additional benefits which is more secure and high potential.},

The trust of these citizens is important for the integration of various data, like sensitive user data, into an open data ecosystem. In the following study, we analyzed whether transparency about the application of open data promotes trust. Furthermore, we formulated guidelines on how to create transparency regarding open data in an ethical way. Using an open-data-based fictitious smart city app, we conducted an experiment analyzing to what extent communication of the technical open data application process and the ethical self-commitment for the transparent communication of data application affect trust in the app's provider. The results indicate that the more information users obtain regarding the use of open data, the more trustworthy they perceive the app provider to be, and the more likely they are to use the app.},

In existing paper recommendation methods, the social interaction factor has yet to play a pivotal role. The authors propose a social network-based research paper recommendation method, that alleviates cold start problems by incorporating users' social interaction, as well as topical relevancy, among assorted papers in the Mendeley academic social network using a novel approach, random walk Ergodic Markov Chain.

abstract = {An online social network (OSN) is crowded with people and their huge number of post and hence filtering truthful content and/or filtering truthful content creator is a great challenge. The online recommender system helps to get such information from OSN and suggest the valuable item or user. But in reality people have more belief on recommendation from the people they trust than from untrusted sources. Getting recommendation from the trusted people derived from social network is called Trust-Enhanced Recommender System (TERS). A Trust-Boosted Recommender System (TBRS) is proposed in this paper to address the challenge in identifying trusted users from social network. The proposed recommender system is a fuzzy multi attribute recommender system using boosted vector similarity measure designed to predict trusted users from social networks with reduced error. Performance analysis of the proposed model in terms of accuracy measures such as precision@k and recall@k and error measures, namely, MAE, MSE and RMSE is discussed in this paper. The evaluation shows that the proposed system outperforms other recommender system with minimum MAE and RMSE.},

abstract = {Explaining suggestions made by recommendation systems is key to make users trust and accept these systems. This is specially critical in areas such as art image recommendation. Traditionally, artworks are sold in galleries where people can see them physically, and artists have the chance to persuade the people into buying them. On the other side, online art stores only offer the user the action of navigating through the catalog, but nobody plays the persuading role of the artist. Moreover, few works in recommendation systems provide a perspective of the many variables involved in the user perception of several aspects of the system such as domain knowledge, relevance, explainability, and trust. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by studying several aspects of the user experience with a recommender system of artistic images, from algorithmic and HCI perspectives. We conducted two user studies in Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate different levels of explainability, combined with different algorithms. While in study 1 we focus only on a desktop interface, in study 2 we attempt to understand the effect of explanations in mobile devices. In general, our experiments confirm that explanations of recommendations in the image domain are useful and increase user satisfaction, perception of explainability and relevance. In the first study, our results show that the observed effects are dependent on the underlying recommendation algorithm used. In the second study, our results show that these effects are also dependent of the device used in the study but with a smaller effect. Finally, using the framework by Knijnenburg et al., we provide a comprehensive model, for each study, which synthesizes the effects between different variables involved in the user experience with explainable visual recommender systems of artistic images.},

So the cloud platform is incorporated in recommender a system that is mainly used for sorting a massive amount of data to identify user's interest by rating or feedback and makes item search easier for the end-user. Therefore, the Cloud-based Recommender system applied in a variety of applications to increase sales and user satisfaction in the market. Despite advances in recommender, the system still issues like sparsity, capability, and accuracy are needed to be addressed. In this paper, the cloud-based approach addresses the serious sparse data and capability issue by constructing a trustworthy recommender system. The proposed technique increases the density of the similarity matrix and coverage for accurate prediction. At the simulation result, the accuracy of recommendation is analyzed using evaluation metrics shows that the framework is useful and better prediction achievement.},

If well cured, these logs can present an asset for analysts. A naive and direct use of these logs is too risky because their provenance and quality are highly questionable. Users of these logs in a trusted way have to be assisted by providing them with in-depth knowledge of the whole LOD environment and tools to cure these logs. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based model inspired by the recent developments in-ontology engineering.

This varying degree of performance could impact users' trust in the system and may pose legal and ethical issues in domains where fairness and equity are critical concerns, like job recommendation. In this paper, we investigate several potential factors that could be associated with discriminatory performance of a recommendation algorithm for women versus men. We specifically study several characteristics of user profiles and analyze their possible associations with disparate behavior of the system towards different genders. These characteristics include the anomaly in rating behavior, the entropy of users' profiles, and the users' profile size. Our experimental results on a public dataset using four recommendation algorithms show that, based on all the three mentioned factors, women get less accurate recommendations than men indicating an unfair nature of recommendation algorithms across genders.},

It uses structured data from multiple domains, and it can be used to conceptualize a concept of interest. Recently, researchers have shown that incorporating contextual features in recommender systems improves rating prediction accuracy. However, identification of contextual features for building context-Aware recommender systems is a major bottleneck. To this end, in this article, we present the development of a context-based recommender system, CRecSys, for item ratings prediction in movie domain. CRecSys extracts item-based contextual features from the underlying dataset and generates an RDF graph to model items and their contextual features for computing context-based items similarity using graph matching techniques and item-based collaborative filtering. It uses LOD and two well-known movie data sources Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for item profiling using a dataset of 1300 movies. CRecSys is experimentally evaluated over two movie datasets, one is generated by the authors and second is the MovieLens-1M benchmark dataset. CRecSys is also compared with ten baselines and two state-of-The-Art recommendation methods, and performs significantly better. It is also empirically established that CRecSys is able to effectively deal with some of the open challenges like cold-start and limited content problems of the traditional recommender systems.},

By exploiting the similarity with the TNGS we conjecture that it may be metaphorically considered a Collective Brain, especially effective in the case of trans-disciplinary representations. Far from being without doubts, in the paper we present the reasons (and the limits) of our proposal that aims to become a useful integrating tool for future quantitative explorations of individual brain functions as well as of collective wisdom at different degrees of granularity. We are therefore challenging each of the current approaches: the logical one in the semantic Web, the statistical one in mining and deep learning, the social one in recommender systems based on authority and trust; not in each of their own preferred field of operation, rather in their integration weaknesses far from the holistic and dynamic behavior of the human brain.},

Although the recommender systems based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) are competent, the user trust information is seldom taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a Trust-Aware Generative adversarial network with recurrent neural network for RECommender systems named TagRec, which makes use of the user trust information for top-N recommendation. In the framework, the discriminative model is a multi-layer perceptron to distinguish whether a sample is from the real data or fake data. The discriminator helps to guide the training of the generative model to make it fit the data distribution of the user trust information. The generative model is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, aiming to confuse the discriminative model by generating samples as similar as possible to the real data. Through the adversarial training between the discriminative and generative models, the user trust information can be fully used to improve the recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real-word datasets to validate the effectiveness of the TagRec.},

abstract = {We build a visual interface for recommending articles to editors at The Browser, a curation service for interesting writing. From a large list of candidates, editors decide which articles are selected and shared with subscribers. To aid the editors in this decision-making task, we build a visual interface for a recommendation model, RANKFROMSETS (RFS) [2], that classifies articles based on their words. Control of the recommendation model is built into the visual interface. For example, an editor can use a topic slider to receive a new list of recommendations according to topical words in articles. These topic sliders might be used to increase or decrease the ranking of articles with words related to crime, business, or technology. The visual interface is also designed to be explanation-aware: words that contribute positively or negatively to an article's ranking are displayed. For the backend of the visual interface, RFS is trained on historical data. In an offline empirical study, we find that RFS outperforms BERT [4], a competitive classification model, in terms of recall. Further, we measure RFS to be 10 times faster to train and to return predictions 2000 times faster than BERT. This speed is a beneficial property for the visual interface, and we demonstrate that RFS can be deployed on the free tier of AWS Lambda using a short python script and numpy dependency. For reproducibility, transparency, and trust of the visual interface, we open source and release a public demonstration,1 data collection, training and deployment scripts, and model parameters.},

Different social media are a source of information that can provide valuable insight into user feedbacks, interaction history and social relationships. With this information it is possible to discover relationships of trust between people that can influence their potential behavior when purchasing a product or service. Social networks have shown to play an important role in e-commerce for the diffusion or acquisition of products. Knowing how to mine information from social networks to discover patterns of social influence can be very useful for e-commerce platforms, or for streaming of music, tv or movies. Discovering influence patterns can make item recommendations more accurate, especially when there is no knowledge about a user's tastes. This paper presents a systematic literature review that shows the main works that use social networking data to identify the most influential set of users within a social network and how this information is used in recommender systems. The results of this work show the main techniques used to calculate social influence, as well as identify which data are the most used to determine influence and which evaluation metrics are used to validate each of the proposals. From 80 papers analyzed, 14 were classified as completely relevant regarding the research questions defined in the SLR.},

abstract = {Trust propagation is being increasingly adopted to assist recommendation systems in providing more reliable information, upon which, users can make more accurate decisions. Optimal trust path search integrating trust value and path length plays a critical role in trust propagation, but suffers from insufficient performance regarding search accuracy and time. Generally, the quality of trust propagation is affected by the path length, and the longer the path is, the worse the trust quality is. However, the length of the path is not the unique crucial factor. Some longer paths with greater trust values may be more credible. In addition, the A∗ algorithm can find an optimal solution, but it expends much time to distinguish some similar paths. The A∗ algorithm is improved and a dynamic weighted heuristic trust path search algorithm is proposed. According to the six-degree space theory, the paths are extended to six-degree admissible trust paths. Then, according to the depths of the nodes in the search path, it relaxes the evaluation function f(n) by devising a dynamic weighted factor w, inserts all nodes satisfied specific conditions into the FOCAL list. Furthermore, it sets the secondary heuristic factor and selects the nodes with the minimum heuristic factor value to reach the target node, and outputs the optimal trust path. Experiments on the public Advogato and FilmTrust datasets demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could efficiently identify the reliable trust paths and predict trust value with high accuracy and reduced computational complexity. The proposed algorithm could be applied to recommendation systems in the future.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems or recommender system (RSs) is one of the hottest topics nowadays, which is widely utilized to predict an item to the end-user based on his/her preferences primary. Recommendation systems applied in many areas mainly in commercial applications. This work aims to collect evidence of utilizing social network information between users to enhance the quality of traditional recommendation system. It provides an overview of traditional and modern approaches used by RSs such as collaborative filter (CF) approach, content-based (CB) approach, and hybrid filter approach. CF is one of the most famous traditional approaches in RSs, which is facing many limitations due to the lack of information available during a performance such as Cold start, Sparsity and Shilling attack. Additionally, this content focused on the role of incorporating a trust relationship from the social network to enhance the weaknesses of CF and achieve better quality in the recommendation process. Trust-aware Recommendation Systems (TaRSs) is a modern approach proposed to overcome the limitations of CF recommendation system in a social network. The trust relationship between users can boost and enhance CF limitations. Many researchers are focusing on trust in the recommendation system but fewer works are highlighting the role of trust in the recommendation system. In the end, limitations, and open issues of the current picture of the recommendation system come across.},

Simple use of these direct trust links may lead to inferior recommend effects, and most of the existed methods don't consider the difference in trust strength. We propose a novel model called TrustE which combines the trust relationships and users similarity. Specifically, we design a new method called Trust Circuit in TrustE to model trust relationships which calculates trust values by taking into account the asymmetry, transitivity, attenuation, and multiplicity-paths of trusts. Then we calculate user similarity through meta-paths guided embedded representation learning in the heterogeneous information network. Finally, we combine trust value and users similarity to get the personalized numbers of reliable potential friends for each user and make recommendation for target user according to his friends' preferences. The experimental results on Epinions and Douban datasets verify that TrustE is superior to other existing recommendation methods and it also has high accuracy for cold-start users' recommendation.},

abstract = {Transparent Recommender Systems, especially those based on machine learning, could convey the reasoning behind their predictions of great importance. In the literature, many Recommender Systems based on Machine Learning have proven their strength. However, focusing on improving accuracy in these systems means more complex algorithms (black-box models), making the reasons behind the prediction difficult to understand. Explainability and efficiency should not be at odds with each other. The few existing neural networks-based recommendation algorithms suffer from data sparsity problems caused by the lack of rated items, or user social information is not exploited. Recently, Knowledge Graphs have been explored for that purpose. However, still, manual efforts are required for feature extraction. Graph Embedding-based algorithms are promising solutions that use the Graph Theory properties to learn user and item feature vectors for generating the recommendation. The goal of this paper is to outline the research questions set out in my Ph.D. thesis related to the transparency and trust in a recommendation by providing an intuitive explanation and to put forward the preliminary ideas to tackle the challenges.},

This is particularly true when they are used in sensitive matters such as health. We addressed these issues in a survey of 163 participants in which we presented three different health-related contexts where recommender systems can be used: 1) desire for better nutrition and more exercise, 2) information about causes and treatment of headaches and nausea, and 3) information about side effects of a medication prescribed by a doctor. We found that participants are generally more willing to disclose their general data than their specifically health-related data. The more health-critical the context of use was, the more willing they were to disclose health-related data.},

abstract = {In recent years, user's trust has gained attention in recommender systems. Trust plays a vital role in the recommendation of online products. Trust is a dynamic feature which evolves with passage of time and varies from person to person. Trust-based cross domain recommender systems suggest items to the users usually by ratings, provided by similar users, often not available in the same domain. However, due to the sparse rating scores, recommender systems cannot generate up-to-the-mark recommendations. In this research, we solved a user cold start problem, mainly by modeling preference drift on a temporal basis. We tried to solve this problem by adopting one of the scenarios of cross domain of 'No Overlap' using cross domain information. In this work, we proposed a model called Trust Aware Cross Domain Temporal Recommendations (TrustCTR) that predict the rating of an item about an active user from the most recent time. We generated user features and item features by using latent factor model and trained the proposed model. We also introduced the concept of trust relevancy that shows the degree of trust, computed the trusted neighbors in target domain for an active user belonging to a source domain, and predicted the ratings of items for cold start users. We performed experiments on public datasets Ciao and Epinions and used these datasets in cross domain form such as the categories of Ciao as source domain and Epinions as the target domain. We selected five different domains, having a higher proportion of rating sparsity, for observing the performance of our approach using MAE, RMSE, and F-measure. Our approach is a viable solution of cold start problem and offers effective recommendations We also compared the model with state-of-the-art methods; the model generates satisfactory results.},

abstract = {Due to technological advancement, cloud computing is an inevitable form of computing these days and is considered a boon to mid-scale industries. As the usage of cloud computing increases day-by-day, the service deployment improves every single day, which paves the way for security threats as well. Finding trustworthy service is a highly challenging problem, which may lead to time consumption or end with inappropriate services. Due to this problem, end user needs trust based appropriate service with minimum time consumption and the service should be reliable too. Hence, a cloud service recommendation system is the current need of the cloud environment. From a pool of available cloud services, the proposed system can recommend the time conserving reliable trustworthy services. This work attempts to keep this as the goal and presents a cloud service recommendation system using clustering based trust degree computation algorithm. Trust measures are deliberating to compute the trust degree (TD) for each dynamic service, which is computed for every time and the historical information is maintained as well. Since the trust agent clustered the services in automated fashion, to isolates the most trustworthy services from all the available clustered cloud services and efficiently allocates services to the end user using trustworthy service allocation algorithm. Process of service search and recommendation needs minimum time consumption. Registering service with trust agent (TA) provides most reliable trust worthy services. The performance of this recommendation system is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F-measure and time consumption rates. The average F-measure rate of the proposed work is computed by varying the count of users from 200 to 300 and the average F-measure rate is 91.85% with minimal time consumption than the existing approaches.},

abstract = {Preferring accuracy over computation time or vice versa is very challenging in the context of recommendation systems, which encourages many researchers to opt for hybrid recommendation systems. Currently, researchers are trying hard to produce correct and accurate recommendations by suggesting the use of ontology, but the lack of techniques renders to take its full advantage. One of the major issues in recommender systems bothering many researchers is pure new user cold-start problem which arises due to the absence of information in the system about the new user. Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative sets standards for interoperability among cross domains and has gathered enormous amount of data over the past years, which provides various ways by which recommender system's performance can be improved by enriching user's profile with relevant features. This research work focuses on solving pure new user cold-start problem by building user's profile based on LOD, collaborative features, and social network-based features. Here, a new approach is devised to compute item similarity based on ontology, thus predicting the rating of nonrated item. A modified method to calculate user's similarity based on collaborative features to deal with other issues such as accuracy and computation time is also proposed. The empirical results and comparative analysis of the proposed hybrid recommendation system dictate its better performance specifically for providing solution to pure new user cold-start problem.},

A vast amount of RDF data has been published in freely accessible and interconnected data sets creating the so-called Linked Open Data cloud. Such a huge amount of data available along with the development of semantic web standards has opened up opportunities for the development of semantic applications. However, most of the semantic recommender systems use only the link structure between resources to calculate the similarity between resources. In this paper we propose HSLD, a hybrid similarity measure for Linked Data that exploits information present in RDF literals besides the links between resources. We evaluate the proposed approach in the context of a LOD-based Recommender System using data from DBpedia. Experiment results indicate that HSLD increases the precision of the recommendations in comparison to pure link-based baseline methods.},

This process faces many challenges, such as the sparsity of user-specified trust relations, the context-awareness of trust and changes in trust values over time.

The confidence value assures the maturity of the interactive relationship between the trust evaluating node and the evaluated node. The defense scheme filters the received recommendations by comparing them with the node's own opinion and in case of no interaction with the evaluated node, it compares with a trusted neighbor's opinion. The neighbor nodes are tagged into three categories: Trusted neighbor, untrusted neighbor and unknown neighbor according to the overall similarity score. The defense scheme only accepts the recommendations from trusted and unknown neighbors. The proposed trust model is simulated and the results show that the model is capable of mitigating the influence of badmouthing and ballot-stuffing attacks.},

However, most existing collaborative recommendation models suffer from poor accuracy due to data sparsity and cold start problems that recommender systems contain only a few explicit data. To solve this problem, a new implicit trust recommendation approach (ITRA) is proposed to generate item rating prediction by mining and utilizing user implicit information in recommender systems. Specifically, user trust neighbor set that has similar preference and taste with a target user is first obtained by trust expansion strategy via user trust diffusion features in a trust network. Then, the trust ratings mined from user trust neighbors are used to compute trust similarity among users based on user collaborative filtering model. Finally, using the above filtered trust ratings and user trust similarity, the prediction results are generated by a trust weighting method. In addition, the empirical experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our rating prediction model has obvious advantages over the state-of-the-art comparison methods in terms of the accuracy of recommendations.},

The data clustering is applied in recommendation system to reduce the computational overhead. It has been shown empirically that with the increase in number of clusters, the rating coverage decreases monotonically. To reduce the impact of clustering, the rating prediction is computed in terms of the user similarity, trust and Jaccard similarity with each term having some coefficient to give them weights. The optimal weights are decided for each clusters which are finally used to make the recommendation. Calculation of optimal parameters is one of the expensive steps and they are fixed for each users of the clusters. In this paper, we dynamically compute the optimal parameters for each pair of users instead of using static optimal parameters for each clusters. The optimal parameters in the proposed approach are individually calculated for two users according to the ratio of Pearson, trust and Jaccard similarity between them. It helps us to reduce the complexity of the system as well as it results into increasing the accuracy of overall recommendations. Experiment results on real datasets illustrate that the our improved 2D-Graph method defeats the competing approaches based on accuracy and rating coverage.},

The emergence of online social network has enriched the user's information, realizing a new way to solve recommendation tasks. Social-aware recommendation algorithms can effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the performance of recommendation systems. Despite the success of these algorithms, they have some common limitations. Most algorithms assume that social networks are homogeneous, with similar preferences among connected users. However, users may only share similar preferences in some aspects. Besides, different friends affect the user's preference in different levels. And this influence of friends on users' preference should be adaptive. Even close friends may have different influences in different decision-making processes. For example, a user may trust a friend in 'travel' but distrust this friend in 'music' because this friend had more travel experiences. Motivated by the above limitations, we designed a neural network model called adaptive attention neural network for social recommendation (ANSR) to study the interaction between a user and his or her social friends as well as infer the complex influence of the user's social relationships on the user's preferences. By utilizing the co-attention mechanism, we can not only extract the user's special attention to certain aspects of their friends but also determine the adaptive influences of different friends on the user. When the user interacts with different items, different attention weights will be assigned to the user and his or her friends, respectively. In addition, we also utilize network embedding to learn more efficient features of each user and incorporate these features into the ANSR to enhance the recommendation results. Moreover, we also conduct extensive experiments on four different real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method performs better on all datasets compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {The current research of recommender system mainly focuses on improving the accuracy of the recommendation, but pays less attention to explainability. Explainability is essential to enhance users' trust and satisfaction, which can even increase the likelihood of buying items. In the existing explainable recommender systems, the mining of explicit and implicit features is not comprehensive, and the interaction among these features is not considered plentifully. In addition, the generated recommended reason text is not personalized and rich enough. It is necessary to improve the quality of recommended reason text because it is difficult to meet the needs of different users by using low-quality text. In this paper, we propose a new method that fuses external knowledge and aspect sentiment to predict rating and generate personalized, content-rich recommended reasons, which applies fine-tuning BERT to solve aspect-based sentiment analysis and extends Transformer to generate recommended reason by using bi-directional attention. The experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrated that our method was effective, and our model was superior to the baseline models on various metrics. For rating prediction task, our model can achieve an improvement of 0.6% on average in terms of RMSE. For recommended reason generation task, our model can achieve an improvement of 9.2% to 11.3% over state-of-the-arts in terms of BLEU.},

abstract = {Group recommender system provides suggestions for a group of users by exploring the choices of individual users of the group. Popularity of group recommender systems is increasing because many activities such as listening to music, watching movies, traveling, etc. are normally performed in groups rather individually. Group recommender systems like personal recommender systems also suffer from cold start and sparsity issues. The cold start and sparsity issues result into inaccurate recommendation computation which degrades the recommendation quality. To handle the cold start and sparsity issues in a Group Recommender System (GRS), this paper proposes to use cross domain approach and introduces Cross Domain Group Recommender System (CDGRS). The recommendations provided by trustworthy and reputed users in the group enhance the acceptance towards the presented recommendations as compared to the other individuals in the group. We have combined the social factors e.g. trust and reputation to get influential user in the group recommendation. A prototype of the system is developed for tourism domain that incorporates four sub-domains i.e. restaurants, hotels, tourist places and shopping places. The performance of CDGRS is compared with GRS. Spearman's Correlation Coefficient, MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall and F-measure are used to find the accuracy of the generated recommendations.},

While following links may result in the discovery of complementary data sources and enriched query results, it is widely recognized that traversing the LOD Cloud indiscriminately results in low quality answers. Over the years, approaches have been published that help to determine whether links are trustworthy or not, based on certain criteria. While such approaches are often useful for specific datasets and/or in specific applications, they are not yet widely used in practice or at the scale of the entire LOD Cloud. This paper introduces a new resource called MetaLink. MetaLink is a dataset that contains metadata for a very large set of owl:sameAs links that are crawled from the LOD Cloud. MetaLink encodes a previously published error metric for each of these links. MetaLink is published in combination with LOD-a-lot, a dataset that is based on a large crawl of a subset of the LOD Cloud. By combining MetaLink and LOD-a-lot, applications are able to make informed decisions about whether or not to follow specific links on the LOD Cloud. This paper describes our approach for creating the MetaLink dataset. It describes the vocabulary that it uses and provides an overview of multiple real-world use cases in which the MetaLink dataset can solve non-trivial research and application challenges that were not addressed before.},

abstract = {Deciphering user purchase preferences, their likes and dislikes is a very tricky task even for humans, making its automation a very complex job. This research work augments heuristic-driven user interest profiling with reviewer credibility analysis and fine-grained feature sentiment analysis to devise a robust recommendation methodology. The proposed credibility, interest and sentiment enhanced recommendation (CISER) model has five modules namely candidate feature extraction, reviewer credibility analysis, user interest mining, candidate feature sentiment assignment and recommendation module. Review corpus is given as an input to the CISER model. Candidate feature extraction module uses context and sentiment confidence to extract features of importance. To make our model robust to fake and unworthy reviews and reviewers, reviewer credibility analysis proffers an approach of associating expertise, trust and influence scores with reviewers to weigh their opinion according to their credibility. The user interest mining module uses aesthetics of review writing as heuristics for interest-pattern mining. The candidate feature sentiment assignment module scores candidate features present in review based on their fastText sentiment polarity. Finally, the recommendation module uses credibility weighted sentiment scoring of user preferred features for purchase recommendations. The proposed recommendation methodology harnesses not only numeric ratings, but also sentiment expressions associated with features, customer preference profile and reviewer credibility for quantitative analysis of various alternative products. The mean average precision (MAP@1) for CISER is 93% and MAP@3 is 49%, which is better than current state-of-the-art systems.},

However, actual social relationships are always sparse, which sometimes bring great harm to the performance of recommender systems. In fact, a user may interact with others that he/she does not connect directly, and thus has an impact on these users. To mine abundant information for social recommendation and alleviate the problem of data sparsity, we study the process of trust propagation and propose a novel recommendation algorithm that incorporates multiple information sources into matrix factorization. We first explore heterogeneous influence strength for each pair of linked users and mine indirect trust between users by using trust propagation and aggregation strategy in social networks. Then, explicit and implicit information of user trust and ratings are incorporated into matrix factorization, and the influence of indirect trust is considered in the recommendation process. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than some state-of-The-Art recommendation models in terms of accuracy and relieves the cold-start problem.},

abstract = {Trust-aware recommender systems have been widely used in recent years to improve the performance of traditional collaborative filtering systems. A common assumption of existing trust models is that all items have the same importance for all users. However, it is reasonable to expect that some items are more significant than others in making recommendations. Furthermore, the significance of an item is not the same for all users but varies depending on many factors such as the demographic characteristics of users. For example, an item that is important to women may not be important to men. Also, the significance of an item for an individual user is not static and can change throughout the life cycle (from childhood to old age). Thus, items that are currently important to a user may become less important in the future. In this paper, we propose a Significance-Based Trust-Aware Recommendation (SBTAR) approach, which uses a new trust measure based on the concept of item significance. The significance of an item for a user is measured with respect to the demographic context of the user. Thus, SBTAR can adapt to dynamic changes in user preferences. To model demographic context, SBTAR uses Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA), which is a meta-heuristic optimization technique based on the social behavior of frogs. SFLA has the advantages of simplicity, fast convergence, strong global search ability and easy implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is more effective and efficient than several state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.},

However, collecting users' observed QoS values is a challenging task for a recommender system. First, users don't want to supply their observed QoS values due to privacy. Second, some user-contributed QoS values may be untrustworthy. There have been some centralized works on credible QoS prediction or privacy-preserving QoS Prediction. However, no research has been done to solve both the two problems simultaneously. Also, it's difficult to guarantee the fairness and independence of the central server. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based Credible and Privacy-Preserving QoS-Aware Web service Recommendation framework. We first separate the traditional Matrix Factorization model into two disjoint parts: private factors and public factors, and train public factors collaboratively while keeping private factors secret. Then, we use blockchain, which based on the peer-to-peer network, to implement our proposed model. Through blockchain, users who don't trust each other can reach a consensus without a central server. We conduct a series of experiments on a realworld dataset and analyze the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy, privacy, security, and complexity.},

The users of these social applications are expanding, forming a large-scale social network. In complex and huge social networks, there are a lot of valuable information waiting to be utilized, so that service providers can provide better services for users. On the other hand, to solve the challenge of information overload brought with the communication technology, the recommendation system is becoming more and more important in many fields. In the context of the social network, a recommendation system can better discover the relationship between users and preferences, thus giving a more accurate recommendation. However, most of the traditional recommendation systems mainly focus on providing personalized recommendation service to a single user which are not suitable for group recommendation such as recommendation for a team or a family. In this paper, we proposed a new method based on trust relationship in social network and attention mechanism of deep learning to solve the group recommendation problem. Specifically, we use attention mechanism to capture different group members's preference weight and we consider trust relation among group members when learning group preference in order to capture more information. Through this method, the accuracy of the recommended results can be further improved. The experimental results on Film Trust dataset show that the proposed algorithm in this paper is able to improve the quality of recommendation compared with the existing group recommendation methods.},

abstract = {Citation recommendation systems play an important role to alleviate the dilemma that scholar users spend a lot of time and experiences for literature survey. With the burgeoning computational models and open data movement, scientific repository can provide more evidence in support of recommendation. On the one hand, recommenders are applying better algorithms to understand the text of user queries and candidate citations. On the other hand, more types of data such as citation network and co-author relationship are aggregated to enrich the citation contextual information. The available data used for recommendation has been extended from textual content to enriched context. This review is conducted to identify the information and methods used for recommendations recently. We begin by introducing definitions of the task, recommending factors along with the corresponding problems and some application platforms. Then, we classify existing recommenders according to user query types and review representative methods for each type. We also elaborate on different strategies applied in three main stages of citation recommendation. Finally, a few open issues for future investigations are proposed.},

abstract = {The objective of developing a recommender system is to aid users by recommending products that might be of interest to them. In this, the collaborative filtering technique is one of the widely used methods where similarities are calculated among users/items to provide personalized recommendation. In order to calculate the similarity, various similarity measures are used. Most of these similarity methods do not perform satisfactorily in the presence of cold start users. A user is considered cold start if he/she has rated less than twenty items. In case of such users, the minimum available ratings data has to be utilized to recommend items. To resolve this problem, we propose a new similarity measure based on both City Block (CB) and Jaccard measure (CBJ). The co-rated items are considered by City Block while Jaccard measure considers the common items for similarity computation. Thus, when both of these measures are combined, they consider all the co-rated and common items. The main advantage of using CBJ is the reduced computational complexity involved in finding the similarity as compared to other similarity methods. To validate CBJ, we conduct experiments on Film Trust and MiniFilm data sets. The recommendation results on Film trust data set having 872 cold start users out of1508 users and MiniFilm data set having all the 55 cold start users reveal that the proposed CBJ method outperforms other existing methods.},

In a knowledge-intensive environment, most works are processed through teamwork. A user on a team can reference task-related documents from other trusted members to support work on the task. However, the traditional personalised recommender systems no longer meet the demand of teams or groups. Therefore, this work proposes a novel document recommendation method based on a group-based trust model. Our method will analyse the degrees of trust among users in a group and then identify the trustworthy users. The proposed group trust consists of a hybrid personal trust (HPT) model and users' importance (i.e. users' activity, similarity and reputation) in a group. Group-based trust is then integrated with the user-based CF to recommend documents to users. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide better performance than other trust-based recommendation methods; it not only obtains reliable trust values to increase the accuracy of predictions but also enhances the recommendation quality.},

In current relevant work, an over-generalized trust relationship is likely to be considered without exploiting the relationship between trust information and interest fields, affecting the precision and reliability of the recommendation. This research, therefore, proposes a users' interest-field-based trust circle model. Based on different interest fields, it exploits potential implicit trust relationships in separated layers. Besides, it conducts user rating by combining explicit trust relationships. This model not only considers the matching between trust information and fields, but also explores the implicit trust relationships between users do not revealed in specific fields, thus it is able to improve the precision and coverage of rating prediction.

As a pre-processing step, we cluster related items and assign only the closest group to each user, producing a reduced set of unknown pairs. The distance between items, and between clusters and users, is computed by comparing item representations and user profiles built based on attributes extracted from the Linked Open Data cloud. We assess the quality of SSR4Rec by applying it into two well-known RS and comparing the results against the same recommenders without our pre-processing step, as well as against other related baselines.

abstract = {Recently, online shopping has become very prominent. Furthermore, most e-commerce platforms use recommender systems to suggest products to the user for potential purchase to help enhance the user experience. Existing recommender models determine the correlation between user profiles and product information to make product recommendations. Although current recommender systems can accurately suggest products, there is a lack of transparency in terms of how the recommendations are made. As a result, users may not trust the suggestions made by what could be perceived as a black box. To address this problem, we have designed a deep recommender system that discovers user preferences and provides the reasons behind the recommendations it makes by examining clues such as user reviews and item descriptions. We adopt the attention mechanism to enhance text analysis capability, which not only enables accurate recommendations but also shows the relationship between products and user profiles. Furthermore, we conduct a case study in which we utilize feature weights to present the reasons to the user by observing attention maps. The results of our experiment show that our model can consistently provide accurate recommendations and justifications to the user. Moreover, our model can handle new items and users, that is, data that is not part of the initial training dataset. Our recommender system is a novel solution that leverages the advantages of content-based and collaborative filtering.},

To consider such important factors, we propose in this paper a novel approach to group recommendations based on fuzzy influence-aware models for Group Decision Making. The proposed model calculates the influence strength between group members from the available information on their interpersonal trust and personality traits (possibly estimated from social networks). The estimated influence network is then used to complete and evolve the preferences of group members, initially calculated with standard recommendation algorithms, toward a shared set of group recommendations, simulating in this way the effects of influence on opinion change during social interactions. The proposed model has been experimented and compared with related works.},

abstract = {Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) present some of the greatest challenges faced by educators, and experience some of the most problematic outcomes. To increase the likelihood that students with EBD will be successful in school and in life, practitioners should implement effective interventions. Trustworthy research is the primary means to identify effective practices. Open science can be used to help verify research findings as trustworthy, as well as improve their accessibility. In this article, we discuss the open science movement and describe five open-science practices (i.e., preregistration, Registered Reports, open data and materials, open access and preprints, and open review) that may help increase the trustworthiness, efficiency, and impact of EBD research. We argue that the implementation of these practices may increase the field's capacity to identify and verify truly effective practices, and facilitate broad accessibility of research for all stakeholders; thereby improving policies and instructional practice for students with EBD.},

abstract = {Trust-aware recommender systems are advanced approaches which have been developed based on social information to provide relevant suggestions to users. These systems can alleviate cold start and data sparsity problems in recommendation methods through trust relations. However, the lack of sufficient trust information can reduce the efficiency of these methods. Moreover, diversity and novelty are important measures for providing more attractive suggestions to users. In this article, a reputation-based approach is proposed to improve trust-aware recommender systems by enhancing rating profiles of the users who have insufficient ratings and trust information. In particular, we use a user reliability measure to determine the effectiveness of the rating profiles and trust networks of users in predicting unseen items. Then, a novel user reputation model is introduced based on the combination of the rating profiles and trust networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to enhance the rating profiles of the users who have low user reliability measure by adding a number of virtual ratings. To this end, the proposed user reputation model is used to predict the virtual ratings. In addition, the diversity, novelty and reliability measures of items are considered in the proposed rating profile enhancement mechanism. Therefore, the proposed method can improve the recommender systems about the cold start and data sparsity problems and also the diversity, novelty and reliability measures. Experimental results based on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher performance than other recommendation methods.},

abstract = {Scholarly peer review is a process of evaluating the suitability of a research work for publication judged by qualified researchers. A professional peer review process ensures the quality of the produced scientific research work. However, there are two main challenges to achieve professional peer review: (1) selecting reviewers with similar competences as the authors (peers) of a submitted research work and (2) resolving any Conflict of Interest (Col) between reviewers and authors. Currently, to solve the first challenge, editors and conferences organizers select reviewers manually. Similarly, the current solution of the second challenge is that authors and reviewers are asked to manually declare any CoI. Such a manual solution is error-prone, waste time, and tedious for reviewers, authors, editors, and organizers. To address the aforementioned two challenges, we have developed a novel recommender system that (1) suggests expert reviewers and (2) resolves any CoI between the recommended reviewers and the author(s) of a submitted paper. To develop our recommender system, we utilized the DBLP citation network database represented as Linked Open Data. To select candidate reviewers who are expert in the topic of a submitted paper without CoIs, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract the topics researchers are working on and the topics of a submitted paper, then our system executes a SPARQL query that returns the best candidate reviewers. Finally, our system executes another SPARQL query that detects any CoIs between the candidate reviewers and the authors of a submitted paper and hence excludes them. Our experimental evaluations corroborate the ability or our system to recommend expert reviewers without CoIs.},

Recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering may have degraded performance due to the problem known as cold start. In an attempt to solve this problem, we should recommend items based on their content. The content-based recommendation systems exploit external data sources, such as web documents or the Linked Open Data, to compare item contents. However, a few proposals make use of the semantic relationship among the items. In this work, we exploit the semantic relationship provided by Linked Open Data (LOD) to search out automatically relevant item features and propose an approach for measuring the similarity between items. This similarity measure leads to a ranked list of similar items. To evaluate our approach, we performed experiments on two domains: museums and movies.

This paper covers one possible angle to the (r)evolution instigated by EVs, i.e., it provides the data science perspective review of the interdisciplinary area at the intersection of green transportation, energy informatics, and economics. Namely, the review summarizes data-driven research in EVs by identifying two main research streams: (i) socio–economic, and (ii) socio–technical. The socio–economic stream includes research in: (i) acceptance of green transportation in countries and among different populations, (ii) current trends in the EV market, and (iii) forecasting future sales for the green transportation. The socio–technical stream includes research in: (i) electric vehicle battery price and capacity and (ii) charging station management. This kind of study is especially important now when the question is no longer whether the transition from internal-combustion engine vehicles to clean-fuel vehicles is going to happen but how fast it will happen and what are going to be implications for society, governmental policies, and industry. Based on the presented literature review, the paper also outlines the most significant open questions and challenges that are yet to be solved: (i) scarcity of trustworthy (open) data, and (ii) designing a generalized methodology for charging station deployment.},

abstract = {Item-based collaborative filtering is one of the most popular techniques in the recommender system to retrieve useful items for the users by finding the correlation among the items. Traditional item-based collaborative filtering works well when there exists sufficient rating data but cannot calculate similarity for new items, known as a cold-start problem. Usually, for the lack of rating data, the identification of the similarity among the cold-start items is difficult. As a result, existing techniques fail to predict accurate recommendations for cold-start items which also affects the recommender system's performance. In this paper, two item-based similarity measures have been designed to overcome this problem by incorporating items' genre data. An item might be uniform to other items as they might belong to more than one common genre. Thus, one of the similarity measures is defined by determining the degree of direct asymmetric correlation between items by considering their association of common genres. However, the similarity is determined between a couple of items where one of the items could be cold-start and another could be any highly rated item. Thus, the proposed similarity measure is accounted for as asymmetric by taking consideration of the item's rating data. Another similarity measure is defined as the relative interconnection between items based on transitive inference. In addition, an enhanced prediction algorithm has been proposed so that it can calculate a better prediction for the recommendation. The proposed approach has experimented with two popular datasets that is Movielens and MovieTweets. In addition, it is found that the proposed technique performs better in comparison with the traditional techniques in a collaborative filtering recommender system. The proposed approach improved prediction accuracy for Movielens and MovieTweets approximately in terms of 3.42% & 8.58% mean absolute error, 7.25% & 3.29% precision, 7.20% & 7.55% recall, 8.76% & 5.15% f-measure and 49.3% and 16.49% mean reciprocal rank, respectively.},

In our work, we introduce a model for Group Decision Making that uses YouTube API to gather rich video contents associated with a finite set of alternatives, e.g. travel destinations. Instead of eliciting subjective opinions on alternatives directly, preferences are built upon a Collaborative Filtering approach, based on each participant's watch history and interaction with items. Randomly chosen videos from different group members are also recommended to each target user in order to infer trust information within the group. We then use trust information to obtain an aggregated group preference for determining places to visit. An application example based on YouTube API shows that a higher degree of interaction consolidates a trust network, resulting in informed decision results.},

The basic assumption behind these works was that "users' preference is similar to or influenced by their friends". Although many studies have attempted to use social relations to enhance recommendation system, they neglected that the heterogeneous nature of online social networks and the variations in users' trust of friends according to different items. As a natural symmetry between the latent preference vector of the user and her friends, we propose a new social recommendation method called ScAN (short for “co-Attention Neural Network for Social Recommendation”). ScAN is based on a co-attention neural network, which learns the influence value between the user and her friends from the historical data of the interaction between the user/her friends and an item. When the user interacts with different items, different attention weights are assigned to the user and her friends respectively, and the user's new latent preference feature is obtained through an aggregation strategy. To enhance the recommendation performance, a network embedding technique is utilized as a pre-training strategy to extract the users' embedding and to incorporate the extracted factors into the neural network model. By conducting extensive experiments on three different real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method ScAN achieves a superior performance for all datasets compare with state-of-the-art baseline methods in social recommendation task.},

abstract = {Recently, social networks have shown huge potential in terms of collaborative web services and the study of peer influence as a result of the massive amount of data, datasets, and interrelations generated. These interrelations cannot guarantee the success of online social networks without ensuring the existence of trust between nodes. Detecting influential nodes improves collaborative filtering (CF) recommendations in which nodes with the highest influential capability are most likely to be the source of recommendations. Although CF-based recommendation systems are the most widely used approach for implementing recommender systems, this approach ignores the mutual trust between users. In this paper, a trust-based algorithm (TBA) is introduced to detect influential spreaders in social networks efficiently. In particular, the proposed TBA estimates the influence that each node has on the other connected nodes as well as on the whole network. Next, a Friend-of-Friend recommendation (FoF-SocialI) algorithm is addressed to detect the influence of social ties in the recommendation process. Finally, experimental results, performed on three large scale location-based social networks, namely, Brightkite, Gowalla, and Weeplaces, to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, are presented. The conducted experiments show a remarkable enhancement in predicting and recommending locations in various social networks.},

abstract = {The quality of recommendations on social networks is a combination of the richness of the available information and the ability of algorithms and architectures to take advantage of this information in favor of the users. Recommendation algorithms have to address several problems, such as information sparsity, scalability of algorithms, concept drift etc. ln this dynamic and complex environment, it is important to provide solutions that enrich information when it is necessary to fill the gaps and at the same time to scale solutions so that they can handle the ever increasing data sizes and flows. ln this work, we extend our previous work on recommender systems for social networks that studied global influence and trust metrics and their applications. More specifically, we introduce a local influence model, which is relied on the formation of local user networks based on common interests and study the performance of the new model, both stand-alone and in combination with the global one. Results show a promising improvement on the similarity between a target user and the users recommended based on the users selected to influence the recommendations for that target user.},

abstract = {Most recommender systems base their recommendations on implicit or explicit item-level feedback provided by users. These item ratings are combined into a complex user model, which then predicts the suitability of other items. While effective, such methods have limited scrutability and transparency. For instance, if a user's interests change, then many item ratings would usually need to be modified to significantly shift the user's recommendations. Similarly, explaining how the system characterizes the user is impossible, short of presenting the entire list of known item ratings. In this paper, we present a new set-based recommendation technique that permits the user model to be explicitly presented to users in natural language, empowering users to understand recommendations made and improve the recommendations dynamically. While performing comparably to traditional collaborative filtering techniques in a standard static setting, our approach allows users to efficiently improve recommendations. Further, it makes it easier for the model to be validated and adjusted, building user trust and understanding.},

Similarity is an important part of recommendation algorithm. However, most current recommendation algorithms ignore the social relation on users, and the most similarity calculations are based on the common object, which does not fully exploit the implicit information. For these challenges, firstly, an adaptive approach which takes both trust and rating into account is proposed to measure the implicit similarity between a user and his friends when the user as a truster and a trustee, respectively. Secondly, a recommendation algorithm combining trust and ratings is proposed, which also takes the biases of users and items, and the user's implicit feedback into account to enhance the accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, the social regularization recommendation algorithm is modified. The experimental results on two different datasets show that the proposed algorithm is able to not only outperform the traditional recommendation algorithm, but also effectively alleviate the data sparsity and cold start problems.},

Central in the development of recommender systems is rating-based preference elicitation, based both on single-criterion and multi-criteria rating. Though its use has already been studied in various domains of recommender systems, far too little attention has been paid to preference elicitation in health recommender systems (HRS). The purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of this preference elicitation by studying the criteria that users consider when they rate a health promotion recommendation from HRS, and accordingly, to offer a design solution as a functional feedback model for mobile health applications. This paper investigates the user-perceived importance of various criteria, as well as latent factors for eliciting user feedback on the recommendations. It also reports the relationship of explanation and trust to the overall rating. By aggregating a list of all possible criteria, we further discover that not all criteria are equally important to users, and that the effectiveness of a recommendation plays a dominant role.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of cloud manufacturing (CMfg), an increasing number of functionally equivalent cloud services are available on the Internet, which makes cloud service recommendation an important topic recently. Since the quality-of-service (QoS) varies largely in cloud environment, many Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches are recently proposed to predict the uncertain QoS by utilizing the historical QoS records of similar users. In addition to the data sparsity problem, however, most existing approaches also ignore the task similarity among different users, while dissimilar tasks requested by similar users may lead to quite different QoS prediction results, and thus cannot achieve higher prediction accuracy and recommendation quality. To address this problem, we develop a novel clustering-based and trust-aware approach. Firstly, a set of similar users can be identified from the view of task similarity using clustering-based algorithm, where task similarity can be computed by incorporating both explicit textual information and rating information as well as implicit context information. Secondly, considering the fact that the QoS values may be contributed by unreliable users, we design a trust-aware CF approach by merging local and global trust values, to reconstruct trust network of the clustered users. Finally, we combine the clustering-based algorithm and trust-aware approach to make a more personalized QoS prediction and reliable cloud service recommendation for the active user in CMfg. Experimental results on two real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

The existing shilling attack detection methods suffer from low precision when detecting attacks in social recommender systems because they focus mainly on the rating pattern differences between attack profiles and genuine ones and ignore the trust relationships between users. In this paper, we propose an approach for detecting shilling attacks in social recommender systems based on time series analysis and trust features (TSA–TF). Firstly, we construct rating distribution time series for items and propose a dynamic rating distribution prediction model to detect suspicious items by using a single exponential smoothing method. Then, we filter out a part of genuine user profiles by analyzing suspicious items and obtain the set of suspicious user profiles. Secondly, we propose four features by combining rating patterns and trust relationships and train a support vector machine (SVM)classifier to discriminate attack profiles in the set of suspicious user profiles. Experiments on the CiaoDVD dataset and Epinions dataset show that the proposed approach can improve the detection precision while maintaining a high recall.},

In order to quickly find favorite items from vast resources, users are eager for technology by which websites can automatically deliver items in which they may be interested. Thus, recommender systems are created and developed to automate the recommendation process. In the field of collaborative filtering recommendations, the accuracy requirement of the recommendation algorithm always makes it complex and difficult to implement one algorithm. The slope one algorithm is not only easy to implement but also works efficient and effective. However, the prediction accuracy of the slope one algorithm is not very high. Moreover, the slope one algorithm does not perform so well when dealing with personalized recommendation tasks that concern the relationship among users. To solve these problems, we propose a slope one algorithm based on the fusion of trusted data and user similarity, which can be deployed in various recommender systems. This algorithm comprises three procedures. First, we should select trusted data. Second, we should calculate the similarity between users. Third, we need to add this similarity to the weight factor of the improved slope one algorithm, and then, we get the final recommendation equation. We have carried out a number of experiments with the Amazon dataset, and the results prove that our recommender algorithm performs more accurately than the traditional slope one algorithm.},

abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0, recommender systems have become a viable means to harness relevant information online. In the past decades, extensive research have been conducted in the field of recommendations — model-based collaborative techniques being the most favored ones. Recently, a new paradigm of trust-based recommendation approach has emerged wherein structural features from social network resulted in an improved efficacy of the algorithms. However, majority of these approaches assume that users' ratings are impacted by all his social connections in friendship network and completely ignore their preferential similarity, which is essential for personalized recommendations. Herein, we address this pivotal issue and propose a two-stage clustering based matrix-factorization algorithm, ‘Cluster REfinement on Preference Embedded MF (CREPE MF)' using a subgraph of social network that integrates preferential similarity score. Also, an immense surge in mobile device usage has been observed in recent times, thereby paving the way for tracking users' locations en-route to physical entity recommendations. As users' locations are geo-spatially co-located, we extend CREPE MF to Geographical CREPE MF (gCREPE MF) by incorporating geo-spatial influence. These two proposed algorithms have been systematically evaluated with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and runtime complexity using two real-world data sets, namely Yelp and Gowalla. Gratifyingly, our approach CREPE MF outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms; depending on the underlying data sets it achieves an improvement of 6.50% to 17.93% in accuracy and 11.67% to 74.23% in runtime. Extended model gCREPE MF further achieves 18.06% to 83.44% reduction in runtime without compromising on accuracy.},

However, certain challenges, such as data sparsity, profiling attack, and black-box recommendation still exist and hamper their prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to predict user ratings by incorporating both trust and context of the users in traditional recommender systems using collaborative filtering method. The similarity between two users is computed using both trust value and context-based similarity. The trust value is based on three trust statements - rating deviation, emotions, and reviews helpfulness. On the other hand, context-based similarity is based on four contextual features - companion, place, day, and priority. The performance of the proposed trust- and context-based hybrid approach is analyzed using mean absolute error and root mean square error on a real dataset generated from two movie data sources (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes), and it performs significantly better in comparison to some of the standard baseline methods. The rating prediction using only trust statements gives better results in comparison to other collaborative filtering approaches, such as user-based and item-based filtering approaches. Similarly, context-based collaborative filtering approach also outperforms standard collaborative filtering approaches. In addition, rating prediction using both trust- and context-based features performs better in comparison to only trust-based or context-based approaches.},

However, they focus on explicit relations between users and they leave out other types of information that can contribute to determine users' global reputation; e.g., public recognition of reviewers' quality. We are interested in understanding if and when these additional types of feedback improve Top-N recommendation. For this purpose, we propose a multi-faceted trust model to integrate local trust, represented by social links, with various types of global trust evidence provided by social networks. We aim at identifying general classes of data in order to make our model applicable to different case studies. Then, we test the model by applying it to a variant of User-to-User Collaborative filtering (U2UCF) which supports the fusion of rating similarity, local trust derived from social relations, and multi-faceted reputation for rating prediction. We test our model on two datasets: the Yelp one publishes generic friend relations between users but provides different types of trust feedback, including user profile endorsements. The LibraryThing dataset offers fewer types of feedback but it provides more selective friend relations aimed at content sharing. The results of our experiments show that, on the Yelp dataset, our model outperforms both U2UCF and state-of-the-art trust-based recommenders that only use rating similarity and social relations. Differently, in the Library Thing dataset, the combination of social relations and rating similarity achieves the best results. The lesson we learn is that multi-faceted trust can be a valuable type of information for recommendation. However, before using it in an application domain, an analysis of the type and amount of available trust evidence has to be done to assess its real impact on recommendation performance.},

However, those methods often focus on a one-size-fit-all trade-off strategy without considering each individual user' specific recommendation situation, which leads to improvements only in individual diversity or aggregate diversity.

Most existing methods are based on the following assumptions: (1) all users can be affected by their friends easily, and (2) users have similar preferences with those that they trust. However, users who are inactive in social networks may be less influenced by friends, and most people share similar preferences with only a few trusted friends. In this paper, we propose a social recommendation method (SocialST) based on social liveness and trust enhancement. SocialST considers social liveness a key factor in the strength of friends' influence on user preference, and a LivenessRank algorithm is designed to compute social liveness. When modeling social relation, we used a power-growth relationship instead of linear function to simulate the relationship between trust strength and similarity of friend preference, thus strengthening the role of close friends. Experimental results from both the Epinions and Ciao datasets have shown that our algorithm outperforms other current social recommendation algorithms in terms of RMSE.},

The proposed structure incorporates three segments: a network factorization demonstrates for the watched rating remaking, a bi-grouping model for the client thing subgroup examination. We recognize uninteresting things that have not been assessed yet rather are presumably going to get low evaluations from customers, and particularly attribute them as low regards. One imperative undertaking in our rating induction structure is the assurance of nostalgic introductions (SO) and qualities of sentiment words. It is on the grounds that deducing a rating from a survey is fundamentally done by removing conclusion words in the audit, and afterward amassing the SO of such words to decide the predominant or normal assumption suggested by the client. The proposed structure and recommend that the system does not depend on a substantial preparing corpus to work. Advance improvement of our rating derivation structure is progressing. Trial results demonstrate that the proposed system indicate changes over the conventional community oriented sifting strategy.},

abstract = {Recommendation system is an efficient way to filter information, and it has been widely used to predict users' potential interests. To build a powerful recommendation system, we need to use as much information as possible to profile users and items precisely, so it can make more accurate and personalized recommendation for users. The recommender which use merely identifications of user and item as features can't fully utilize the information provided by the data, but also decrease the generalization of the model which have poor performance in both academia and industry. So, using multiple features and learning the intrinsic complex relationship among them are critical for a good recommendation system. In this work, we propose an end-to-end, deep learning based recommendation model without feature engineering. The model consists of two parts, which are used to capture the low-order linear relationship and high-order nonlinear relationship of the features called Weighted Interactive Model and Deep Model. In the Weighted Interactive Model, we use pointwise multiplication to capture low-order relationship of two features. To make the model more expressive, each interaction and dimension of the interactions are assigned by different weights. In addition, we use the user-item rating matrix to build expressions of user and item, which improves generalization of the model. We have conducted many experiments on the open data set for different parameters, and the results outperform than other state-of-the-art methods which show the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Then, we make an improvement on the traditional MF model to deal with data sparsity. Specifically, the MF process has been extended from both the user and item sides with implicit feedback information and semantic similar items, respectively. Experiments on two real datasets show that our proposed semantic similarity measure and recommender model are superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in recommendation performance.},

Our first field of application focuses on the French Pyrenees. In order to achieve our goal, we worked on two fronts: (i) the ability to export this data from their original databases and data models to well-known open data platforms; and (ii) the proposition of an open-source algorithm and framework capable of recommending a sequence of cultural heritage points of interests (POIs) to be visited by tourists. This itinerary recommendation approach is original in many aspects: it not only considers the user preferences and popularity of POIs, but it also integrates different contextual information about the user as well as the relevance of specific sequences of POIs (strong links between POIs). The ability to export the cultural heritage data as open data and to recommend sequences of POIs are being integrated in a first prototype.},

abstract = {The routing protocol is a prerequisite for the effective operations of vehicular ad hoc networks (i.e., VANETs) in the transportation cyber-physical system (i.e., T-CPS). As the basis of mobile information and communication technologies in VANETs, these protocols must be able to establish effective and efficient routing paths to guarantee timely and reliable data transmission between vehicles. However, the rapid movement of vehicles leads to frequent changes in topology and increases the difficulty of designing routing protocols. Due to the excessive reliance on computing, communication and control technologies, VANETs are vulnerable to various types of malicious attacks in the absence of public key infrastructure. And the security of information transmission is significantly threatened. To tackle the routing security issue, this paper proposes an attack-resistant light-weight trust-based secure multicast routing protocol (i.e., TSMRP), which can resist multiple malicious attacks based on the integration of trust. This paper first designs a highly efficient trust computing model, which integrates two trust decision factors, as the direct trust and the recommendation trust, to derive the overall trust value of a vehicle. During the construction of direct trust model, the grey Markov prediction algorithm based on the fluctuation type recognition is utilized to calculate the direct trust value of a specific vehicle accurately. Meanwhile, during the construction of recommendation trust model, the recommending vehicles are classified into three types based on their interaction relationship with the monitoring vehicle. And further, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process based on entropy mechanism is used to assign optimal weights for these three types of recommendation trust. Secondly, the NetLogo simulation platform is used to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of this trust computing model, which can effectively improve the detection rate and the identification accuracy of malicious vehicles. This direct trust model can not only deal with the common black/grey hole attacks but can also effectively identify the timing-shift attacks. The recommendation trust model can effectively deal with slander attacks and collusion attacks. Thirdly, a trust-based secure multicast protocol (i.e., TSMRP) is designed to effectively identify and suppress malicious vehicles during the route establishment phase and the route maintenance phase. Thereby, this new trust-based routing protocol can develop communication paths of high security and reliability via excluding the malicious relay vehicles. Besides, to further improve routing efficiency, this paper proposes two improvement mechanisms including the forwarding group node reuse mechanism and the edge path deletion mechanism during the route maintenance phase. These two mechanisms can reduce the number of forwarding group nodes and the flooding of routing request packets effectively, thus reduce the routing overhead caused by trust model fusion and avoid the loss of a large number of packets due to the link blocking. These beneficial effects make this new proposed protocol more adaptable to the environment with high mobility. Finally, compared with the other relevant protocols, the detailed experimental results show that the TSMRP improves the packet delivery ratio. On the contrary, the routing overhead, the average end-to-end latency and the byte sent per byte delivered are reduced.},

We conducted an empirical study in which we compared these two sources of recommendations and explanations. Human advisors were asked to explain movies they recommended in short texts while the RS created explanations based on item similarity. Our experiment comprised two rounds of recommending. Over both rounds the quality of explanations provided by users was assessed higher than the quality of the system's explanations. Moreover, explanation quality significantly influenced perceived recommendation quality as well as trust in the recommendation source. Consequently, we suggest that RS should provide richer explanations in order to increase their perceived recommendation quality and trustworthiness.},

In this work, we propose a new path based trust inference method utilizing the implicit influence information available in the existing trust network. The proposed approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we define a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global influence in the inferred trust along a path and considers the maximum trust gaining path between two users. To reduce the sparsity of the network further, we use the projected user network information from user-item feedback history to reconstruct the inferred trust and introduce two methods of reconstruction from the truster and trustee point of view. The proposed reconstruction process can infer the trusted neighbors for a user who has put no trust on others, so far. We have applied the techniques in two real-world datasets and achieved significant performance improvement from the existing trust-based and neighborhood-based methods.},

abstract = {Friend recommendation (FR) in social networks has been widely studied in recent years, which mainly focuses on social relationships and user interests. Friend of Friend method is one representative. However, the disadvantage is that most of existing solutions ignored other valuable information, such as user profile, location, influence and indirect trust. In fact, being friends among users is either determined by one or two dominant factors that originate from varying information sources, or the results of multiple main factors gaming. Motivated by the observations above, we propose a scalable FR framework in social networks, where multiple sources have been integrated based on improved D-S evidence theory. More specifically, we first analyzed 7 valuable information sources and categorized them into three classes, including Personal Features, Network Structure Features and Social Features. Furthermore, we also propose a fusion recommendation framework based on D-S evidence theory which embodies the minimal conflicts among evidences. In the proposed method, we first optimize the framework by importance degree and reliability of evidence based on original D-S evidence theory. Then, we designed a novel BPA evidence function by quantifying the evidence, where each evidence measures the relevance of forming friends among users. Finally, we describe the fusion FR algorithm plugged into our recommendation framework. The experiments on real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art algorithms on five evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing multi-source information for FR in social networks.},

abstract = {Recommender systems try to propose a list of main interests of an on line social network user based on his predicted rating values. In the recent years, several methods are proposed such as Interest Social Recommendation method (ISoRec), and Social Recommendation method based on trust Sequence Matrix Factorization which employs matrix factorization techniques to address the trust propagation and sequential behaviors issues. Main drawback of these works is that they ignore implicit interest of users. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to solve user-item rating based on the trust, sequential interest and the implicit interest of users, simultaneously. In order to solve this problem, our proposed method combines these parameters as its inputs. This method based on matrix factorization named as ISoTrustSeq. Experimental results show higher accuracy of predicted values in compared to the above-mentioned methods. Our results are also much better than these methods in terms of variation in the number of user-items features.},

abstract = {In recent years, an increase in group activities on websites has led to greater demand for highly-functional group recommender systems. The goal of group recommendation is to capture and distill the preferences of each group member into a single recommendation list that meets the needs of all group members. Existing aggregation functions perform well in harmonious and congruent scenarios, but tend not to generate satisfactory results when group members hold conflicting preferences. Moreover, most of current studies improve group recommendation only based on a single aggregation strategy and explicit trust information is still ignored in group recommender systems. Motivated by these concerns, this paper presents TruGRC, a novel Trust-aware Group Recommendation method with virtual Coordinators, that combines two different aggregation strategies: result aggregation and profile aggregation. As each individual's preferences are modeled, a virtual user is built as a coordinator to represent the profile aggregation strategy. This coordinator provides a global view of the preferences for all group members by interacting with each user to resolve conflicting preferences. Then, we also model the impact from group members to the virtual coordinator in accordance with personal social influence inferred by trust information on social networks. Group preferences can be easily generated by the average aggregation method under the effect of the virtual coordinator. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with a range of different group sizes show that TruGRC method has significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems alleviate the problem of information overload by helping users find information relevant to their preference. Memory-based recommender systems use correlation-based similarity to measure the common interest among users. The trust between users is often used to address the issues associated with correlation-based similarity measures. However, in most applications, the trust relationships between users are not available. A popular method to extract the implicit trust relationship between users employs prediction accuracy. This method has several problems such as high computational cost and data sparsity. In this paper, addressing the problems associated with prediction accuracy-based trust extraction methods, we proposed a novel trust-based method called AgreeRelTrust. Unlike accuracy-based methods, this method does not require the calculation of initial prediction and the trust relationship is more meaningful. The collective agreements between any two users and their relative activities are fused to obtain the trust relationship. To evaluate the usefulness of our method, we applied it to three public data sets and compared the prediction accuracy with well-known collaborative filtering methods. The experimental results show our method has large improvements over the other methods.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful and extensive methods used by recommender systems for predicting the preferences of users. However, traditional collaborative filtering only uses rating information to model the user, the data sparsity problem and the cold start problem will severely reduce the recommendation performance. To overcome these problems, we propose two neural network models to improve recommendations. The first one called TDAE uses a denoising autoencoder to integrate the ratings and the explicit trust relationships between users in the social networks in order to model the preferences of users more accurately. However, the explicit trust information is very sparse, which limits the performance of this model. Therefore, we propose a second method called TDAE++ for extracting the implicit trust relationships between users with similarity measures, where we employ both the explicit and implicit trust information together to improve the quality of recommendations. Finally, we inject the trust information into both the input and the hidden layer in order to fuse these two types of different information to learn more reliable semantic representations of users. Comprehensive experiments based on three popular data sets verify that our proposed models perform better than other state-of-the-art approaches in common recommendation tasks.},

Social recommendation is one of recommendation systems, which has gradually become the hot research field of recommendation because it can better simulate the recommendation process in the real world and better reflect the role of people in the process of recommendation. However, most of the existing methods of social recommendation ignore the impact of the item's contextual information, and only consider the connection between users. In order to take full advantage of contextual information and social relationships into consideration, this paper proposes a novel social recommendation method, named SocialConvMF, which integrates trust relationship and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into Probability Matrix Factorization (PMF). First, it uses the trust-aware social recommendation method; then captures contextual information in the document; finally, it utilizes trust-aware and contextual information to do social recommendation.

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose a trust-based ant-colony recommender system. It achieves high accuracy and coverage by integrating the importance level of friends. This paper has two main contributions, namely, selecting higher-quality raters and improving the prediction step. From these two contributions, the proposed trust-based ant-colony recommender system could provide more accurate and wider-coverage prediction than existing systems. Design/methodology/approach: To obtain higher-quality raters, the data set was preprocessed, and then, trust values were calculated. The depth of search was increased to obtain higher coverage levels. This work also focuses on the importance level of friends in the system. Because the levels of influence on the active user of all friends are not equal, the importance level of friends is integrated into the system by transposing rater's rating to the active user's perspective and then assigning a weight to each rater. Findings: The experimental evaluation clearly demonstrates that the proposed method achieves better results in terms of both accuracy and coverage than existing trust-based recommender systems. It was found that integrating the importance level of friends into the system, which transposes ratings and assigns weight to each user, can increase accuracy and coverage. Originality/value: Existing trust-based ant-colony recommender systems do not consider the importance level of friends in the prediction step. Most of them only focus on finding raters and then using the rater's real ratings in the prediction step. A new method is proposed that integrates the importance level of friends into the system by transposing a rater's rating to match the active user's perspective and assigning a weight for each rater. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves better accuracy and coverage than existing systems.},

This attention is embodied in the various shapes social trust has taken, such as its use in recommendation systems, viral marketing and expertise retrieval. Hence, it is essential to implement frameworks that are able to temporally measure a user's credibility in all categories of big social data. To this end, this article suggests the CredSaT (Credibility incorporating Semantic analysis and Temporal factor), which is a fine-grained credibility analysis framework for use in big social data. A novel metric that includes both new and current features, as well as the temporal factor, is harnessed to establish the credibility ranking of users.

Some researchers have proposed local trust models to measure trust between two users based on their interactions. However, in most cases, there are few (if any) direct interactions between two users. In such cases, it is useful to associate a user with a global reputation value that reflects the experience of the whole community with that user. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Local–Global Trust-aware Recommendation (DLGTR) approach, which uses a new hybrid model of local and global trust. In this hybrid model, the relative importance of local trust versus global trust is dynamically determined based on the reliability of information from the two trust models. Moreover, DLGTR uses an incremental method to efficiently update a trust network as new data become available. This allows DLGTR to constantly improve the recommendation quality without loss of efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches, especially in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) aim to help users to find relevant information based on their preferences instead of searching through extensive volume of information using search engines. Accurate prediction of unknown ratings is one of the key challenges in the analysis of RSs. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a well-known recommendation method that estimates missing ratings by employing a set of similar users to the target user. An outstanding topic in CF is picking out an appropriate set of users and using them in the rating prediction process. In this paper, a novel CF method is proposed to predict missing ratings accurately. The proposed method called TCFACO uses trust statements as a rich side information with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method. TCFACO consists of three main steps. In the first step, users are ranked considering available rating values and social trust relationships. Then, in the second step, the ACO method is utilized to assign proper weight values to users to show how they are similar to the target user. A set of top similar users is filter out in the third step to be used in predicting unknown ratings for the target user. In other words, to speed up identifying similar users, the proposed method first filters out a majority part of dissimilar users and then runs the ACO on only a reduced set of users to weight them. Several experiments were performed on three real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Trust prediction has been a vital part in trust-aware recommender systems. There are two approaches to predict trust between users: an explicit-information approach and an implicit-information approach. The explicit-information approach uses the explicit trust information observed from a trustor-trustee pair, whereas the implicit-information approach uses the implicit-information inferred from interaction features between a candidate trustor-trustee pair. The existing researches on trust prediction have been mainly focusing on one kind of information rather than combining the two kinds collectively. The task of trust prediction, however, could be improved when all kinds of information available from user pairs are integrated. Thus, we develop a new framework, including trust propagation mechanisms based on trust-message passing which takes advantage of the two kinds of information. In the developed framework, we build various probability-based trust prediction models according to the way of integrating the trust propagation mechanisms. Using real-world data, we empirically determine a weight vector for the integration of the trust propagation mechanisms and select the best trust prediction model. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed trust propagation mechanisms by showing that the proposed method, ITD, outperforms existing methods, ABIT_L and MoleTrust, by 12.5 and 29.1%, respectively, in accuracy.},

First, SCTCMAR defines a social circle of users in terms of user's purpose in choosing an automobile; on this basis, a method to calculate personal preference is put forward. and preference similarity is put forward. Second, a convolution neural network model is designed to learn the hidden features from the automobile comment texts. Afterwards, both the social circle and comment text features are integrated into the recommendation model, and low-rank matrix decomposition technology is used to solve the problem. In addition, by applying the GloVe pre-training word embedded model to SCTCMAR, an improved version, SCTCMAR+ is further proposed. Finally, a performance of comparison SCTCMAR+, SCTCMAR with FMM (flexible mixture model), TR (trust rank), and Random sampling is performed on a real dataset with 266 995 users and 702 automobiles. Experimental results show that SCTCMAR+ and SCTCMAR models outperform other counterparts in precision, recall and ARHR (average reciprocal hit rank).},

abstract = {Recommender systems can utilize Linked Open Data (LOD) to overcome some challenges, such as the item cold start problem, as well as the problem of explaining the recommendation. There are several techniques in exploiting LOD in recommender systems; one approach, called Linked Data Semantic Distance (LDSD), considers nearby resources to be recommended by calculating a semantic distance between resources. The LDSD approach, however, has some drawbacks such as its inability to measure the semantic distance resources that are not directly linked to each other. In this paper, we first propose another variation of the LDSD approach, called wtLDSD, by extending indirect distance calculations to include the effect of multiple links of differing properties within LOD, while prioritizing link properties. Next, we introduce an approach that broadens the coverage of LDSD-based approaches beyond resources that are more than two links apart. Our experimental results show that approaches we propose improve the accuracy of the LOD-based recommendations over our baselines. Furthermore, the results show that the propagation of semantic distance calculation to reflect resources further away in the LOD graph extends the coverage of LOD-based recommender systems.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation approach that has been extensively employed in recommender systems. However, it suffers from some weaknesses, including problems with cold start users, data sparsity and difficulty in detecting malicious users. Trust-based recommender systems can overcome these weaknesses by using the ratings of trusted users. However, since users often provide few trust statements, trust networks are typically sparse and therefore the cold start and sparsity problems still remain. In this paper, we use the positive correlation between trust and interest similarity to enrich trust network by similarity relations and propose a stochastic trust propagation-based method, called LTRS, which utilizes the enriched trust network to provide enhanced recommendations. In comparison with existing recommender systems combining trust and similarity information, the proposed system (1) incorporates both trust and similarity relations in the trust propagation process and, in this way, increases the coverage and accuracy of predictions; and (2) addresses the dynamic nature of both trust and similarity by modelling the enriched network as a stochastic graph, and continuously captures their variations during the recommendation process and not at fixed intervals. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the recommendation accuracy and coverage.},

abstract = {Providing explanations in a recommender system is getting more and more attention in both industry and research communities. Most existing explainable recommender models regard user preferences as invariant to generate static explanations. However, in real scenarios, a user's preference is always dynamic, and she may be interested in different product features at different states. The mismatching between the explanation and user preference may degrade costumers' satisfaction, confidence and trust for the recommender system. With the desire to fill up this gap, in this paper, we build a novel Dynamic Explainable Recommender (called DER) for more accurate user modeling and explanations. In specific, we design a time-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) to model user dynamic preferences, and profile an item by its review information based on sentence-level convolutional neural network (CNN). By attentively learning the important review information according to the user current state, we are not only able to improve the recommendation performance, but also can provide explanations tailored for the users' current preferences. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our model for improving recommendation performance. And to evaluate the explainability of our model, we first present examples to provide intuitive analysis on the highlighted review information, and then crowd-sourcing based evaluations are conducted to quantitatively verify our model's superiority.},

However, most current MF-based recommenders cannot obtain high prediction accuracy due to the sparseness of the user–item matrix in collaborative filtering models. Moreover, they suffer from scalability issues when applied to large-scale real-world tasks. To tackle these issues, a social regularization method, called TrustANLF, is proposed, which incorporates users' social trust information in a nonnegative matrix factorization framework. The proposed method integrates trust statements as an additional information source along with rating values into the recommendation model to deal with the data sparsity and cold-start issues. Moreover, the alternating direction optimization method is used for solving the trust-based nonnegative MF model in order to improve convergence speed as well as reduce computational and memory costs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experiments are performed on three real-world datasets. The obtained results demonstrate the significant improvements of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Recommender or recommendation systems have gained popularity in recent years, and big data is the driving force behind recommendation systems. Recommendation systems changed the way websites communicate with the users by providing a recommendation based on users history such as purchases and searches. Recommendation systems are used in a variety of areas such as movies, music, research articles and social tags. For example, recommendation system in Facebook “People you may know, " Netflix “Because you watched” and YouTube “Recommend for you.” These systems usually produce a list of recommendations in two ways: collaborative and content-based (CB) filtering. Collaborative filtering (CF) is based on a model of prior user behavior, which can be constructed from sole user's action or from the actions of other users who have similar behaviors, while content-based filtering constructs a recommendation on user's behavior such as by using historical browsing information. Apart from these, the hybrid approach can be used by combining two models. While designing, such systems require compute function values at several thousand points and thus are computationally quite extensive. These systems need parallel computations to speed up the search for an acceptable solution that can be recommended through nature-inspired computation. There are many factors that are essential while designing accurate recommendation algorithms. Some of these factors are diversity, recommender persistence, privacy, user demographics, trust and labeling. Recommendation system cannot perform its job without data, and big data supplies the amount of user's data such as past purchase history, browsing history [1, 2]. In fact, efficient recommendation system requires big data. The best solution is Hadoop; it is a platform used to store, generate, manage and distribute big data easily around several large server nodes [3-5]. Hadoop offers Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), which distributes all the data in different clusters and performs parallel operations. This chapter will explore big data issues and specific in Hadoop and HDFS.},

abstract = {The fast evolution of e-learning systems offers learners with huge opportunities for accessing learning activities via online. This largely provides support and improvement to the learning practices of the users. Nonetheless the problems corresponding to e-learning systems limit its application success. This is due to the fact that several learning activities like different learning materials, subjects, and learning resources, which are developing in this online world makes an e-learning system hard. It is difficult for the individual learners to choose optimized activities for their specific situations/requirements/query, since there exists no personalized service that belongs to that specific user. Recommender systems, which target a trendering personalized environment for studying materials can be utilized for resolving those issues in e-learning system. The available system proposed an e-learning personalization depending on the strategy of hybrid recommendation in cloud-based platform. It presented a recommendation system named as Protus that can do the automatic adjustment to the levels of preferences and expertise of the learners. It identifies various patterns of learning style and behaviours of the learners' by means of testing the learning styles of the learners and then having their server logs. Nonetheless it does not accomplish optimal clustering and also does not take the trust value of user into consideration for improving the accuracy. In order to resolve this problem, the new system proposed a trust based hybrid recommendation (TBHR) strategy. Here, in this system, the learning style and the habits of the learners' are evaluated so as to test the learning styles of the learners and then their server logs are mined. Then the noises are eliminated employing re-rating mechanisms. Depending on the various learning styles, the leaners are clustered by making use of hybrid firefly and K-means algorithms. Afterwards, the behavior and the preferences of the learners are analyzed by carrying out the mining of the sequences observed frequently by the AprioriAll algorithm. Trust-based weighted mean is utilized for analyzing the trust value of users. At last, this system finishes the customized recommendation of the learning content based on the ratings corresponding to these sequences observed frequently, rendered with the help of the Protus system. The system proposed attains a better performance in comparison with the available system in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) metric, accuracy and speed.},

We know the general effect on systems' ability to predict accurately, and we also know the amount of knowledge that attackers need to know about the system to deploy a realistic attack. In this chapter, we show that the two approaches, i.e. user-based and item-based algorithms, are particularly vulnerable to attack patterns, but hybrid algorithms that are the combination of both user-based and item-based algorithms may present higher stability.

Here, the core value-generating mechanisms of these platforms relate to the recommendations that persuade users to make future transactions, thereby driving sales, customer satisfaction, efficiency, and trust. To generate effective recommendations, accurate user profiling is fundamental. Ubiquitous computing provides valuable data to enhance user profiling by uncovering behavioral patterns of individual users. Specifically, through machine learning methods, recommendation systems are able to understand users better by considering both past individual behaviors and their respective contexts. However, state-of-the-art recommendation systems rely either on collaborative or content-based approaches, thereby neglecting a user's time-varying contexts and the dynamics that influence these contexts. We address this shortcoming by developing a context-aware and user-specific hybrid recommendation system using transfer-learning techniques based on (recurrent) neural networks.

abstract = {In recommendation systems (RSs), nowadays, not only the traditional user-item rating matrices but also more additional information like contents, contexts, trust friends and other auxiliary information are available to enhance the performance of RS, leading to content-aware, context-aware, trust-aware RS, etc. Thus, it provides much potential to take into consideration the additional information in RS. Hence, we focus on a general low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) model with similarity constraints and propose a decentralized algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to relieve the computation burden in each server while preserving privacy. What's more, we utilize low-complexity skills in numerical analysis to reduce the computational complexity, based on the exploitation of the special form of the problem. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

Recently, providing explanations about why items are recommended has attracted increasing attention due to its capability to enhance user trust and satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a co-attentive multitask learning model for explainable recommendation. Our model improves both prediction accuracy and explainability of recommendation by fully exploiting the correlations between the recommendation task and the explanation task. In particular, we design an encoder-selector-decoder architecture inspired by human's information-processing model in cognitive psychology. We also propose a hierarchical co-attentive selector to effectively model the cross knowledge transferred for both tasks. Our model not only enhances prediction accuracy of the recommendation task, but also generates linguistic explanations that are fluent, useful, and highly personalized. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are being increasingly used to predict the preferences of users on online platforms and recommend relevant options that help them cope with information overload. In particular, modern model-based collaborative filtering algorithms, such as latent factor models, are considered state-of-the-art in recommendation systems. Unfortunately, these black box systems lack transparency, as they provide little information about the reasoning behind their predictions. White box systems, in contrast, can, by nature, easily generate explanations. However, their predictions are less accurate than sophisticated black box models. Recent research has demonstrated that explanations are an essential component in bringing the powerful predictions of big data and machine learning methods to a mass audience without compromising trust. Explanations can take a variety of formats, depending on the recommendation domain and the machine learning model used to make predictions. The objective of this work is to build a recommender system that can generate both accurate predictions and semantically rich explanations that justify the predictions. We propose a novel approach to build an explanation generation mechanism into a latent factor-based black box recommendation model. The designed model is trained to learn to make predictions that are accompanied by explanations that are automatically mined from the semantic web. Our evaluation experiments, which carefully study the trade-offs between the quality of predictions and explanations, show that our proposed approach succeeds in producing explainable predictions without a significant sacrifice in prediction accuracy.},

However, item recommendation has been confronted with some inherent problems, such as sparse ratings and long-tail distribution, resulting in low accuracy of recommendations and insignificant marketing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning model based on trust diffusion and global item (TDGIL) to improve the accuracy of item rating prediction for recommender systems. Specifically, first, the rating information on items is mined and aggregated to the greatest extent based on trust diffusion characteristics among users. The benchmark prediction of item recommendation is updated by a user trust neighbor set and its item ratings, which are obtained by a trust diffusion algorithm. Then, the difference weights and compensation coefficients for all items are defined to learn users' potential preferences in the proposed global item model. Finally, the TDGIL learning algorithm is presented to train and learn the target networks by random gradient descent. The extensive experiments and results on two real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed model can achieve significant improvements in the accuracy of rating prediction compared with some state-of-the-art methods.},

Therefore, the paper investigates how similarity-based retrieval strategies can be combined with graph queries to enable users or system providers to explore repositories in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud more thoroughly. For this purpose, we developed novel content-based recommendation approaches. They rely on concept annotations of Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabularies and a SPARQL-based query language that facilitates advanced and personalized requests for openly available knowledge graphs. We have comprehensively evaluated the novel search strategies in several test cases and example application domains (i.e., travel search and multimedia retrieval). The results of the web-based online experiments showed that our approaches increase the recall and diversity of recommendations or at least provide a competitive alternative strategy of resource access when conventional methods do not provide helpful suggestions. The findings may be of use for Linked Data-enabled recommender systems (LDRS) as well as for semantic search engines that can consume LOD resources.},

However, it is difficult for traditional recommendation systems to interpret recommendation results. In order to improve users' trust in recommendation results, interpretable recommendation models have attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we present the Explanation Chains Model based on the Fine-grained Data (F-ECM) to enhance the effectiveness of recommendation while achieving the interpretability of recommendation. First, we generate parsing trees from user comments and extract three key sentence structure information (i.e., aspects, features and sentiment tendency) from those generated parsing tree. The fine-grained similarity is computed based on the aspects and features of the products to be recommended, and users' product satisfaction is predicted by combining sentiment tendency. Then the recommendation chain will be constructed according to the satisfaction degree in the recommendation list. Finally, we calculate recommendation chain scores of all the items to be recommended to the target user, generate the recommendation results and personal explanation for the user by the recommendation chains. Experiments in the Amazon data set show that the Explanation Chains Model based on the Fine-grained Data achieve better interpretability and performance of product recommendation systems.},

Our analysis on the collected data showed the acceptance of all hypotheses in the model. The result of the Structural Equations Modelling showed that trust has a significant relationship with the customers' satisfaction in the e-commerce recommendation systems. In addition, the results revealed that satisfaction with the recommended products can improve the customers' loyalty in the B2C recommendation systems. The proposed model will help the e-commerce managers to improve their website recommendation systems and increase the sale of the products by achieving the customers' loyalty in the online shopping websites.},

abstract = {E-commerce recommender systems (RSs) can help users quickly find what they need or new products they might be interested in. To continuously enhance user trust in the website, improve page visits and dwell time, and most importantly, increase gross merchandise value (GMV), it is crucial to understand and capture the important information hidden in the data, which has a great impact on user choice. The fashion e-commerce websites can collect the attributes of items and users as well as the user purchase behaviors, but lack the fine-grained classification of the items and the implicit relationship between items and users. This paper focuses on Amazon fashion dataset, one of the most widely used datasets in the fashion field. A differentiated recommendation framework is proposed that provides different recommendation paths for active and inactive users to improve the overall recommendation quality. In the framework, a data augmentation algorithm based on transfer learning is proposed to filter out the irrelevant items and label items with fine-grained tags, and a user-item knowledge graph is built to discover the potential relationship between items and users. Finally, a differentiated recommendation strategy is put forward to make different recommendations for users with different characteristics. The experimental results show that through data augmentation algorithm to improve data quality, factorization machine model produces higher recommendation accuracy, the constructed knowledge graph can alleviate the cold start problem for recommendation, and the differentiated recommendation strategy has achieved better recommendations for both active and inactive users.},

However, the accuracy still has a large space to improve, and the cold-start problem also restricts the performance of recommender systems. Aiming at optimising these two problems, ISIRS model is proposed. ISIRS integrates social influence into recommendations. Considering celebrity effect in sociology, ISIRS applies information theory to capture the social influence in a social network. As a result, ISIRS can find famous persons in a social network by sorting social influence of all people. ISIRS then makes use of the preferences of these famous people to make recommendations more accurate. The results of experiments show that ISIRS model outperforms the recommendation based on users, the recommendation based on items and the MF recommendation algorithm, even though the rating matrix and trust relationship are sparse. These results prove ISIRS can help both the accuracy and the cold-start problem in recommendations.},

In this paper we propose a discrete trust-aware matrix factorization (DTMF) model to take dual advantages of both social relations and discrete technique for fast recommendation. Specifically, we map the latent representation of users and items into a joint hamming space by recovering the rating and trust interactions between users and items.

abstract = {In face-to-face interactions, advice acceptance depends on how it is presented, as well as a number of social factors. For example, some persons are inclined to accept advice from an expert if they possess little domain knowledge. In contrast, if such advice is unsolicited, persons might only accept advice from a trusted source, such as a family member. Whether these mechanisms also play a role in the recommender context is unknown, even though advice solicitation may be particularly important in domains where a recommender user seeks behavioral change (e.g. energy conservation, healthy eating). This study examines the role of advice solicitation (i.e. whether one asks for advice or simply receives it) and advice source (i.e. either explained in social terms or not) in our 'Saving Aid' energy recommender system. Through a web-based user study with 252 participants, we find that allowing users to solicit advice themselves increases their perceived level of trust with our energy recommender system, compared to users that are presented unsolicited advice. In turn, we find that trust positively affects user satisfaction levels, as well as the number of chosen energy-saving measures. We discuss how system designers should consider how advice is presented and in which context.},

GameRecs is capable of producing both user profiles based on Steam's user data, as well as video game recommendations for those profiles. It generates group recommendations by exploiting lists aggregation methods, and focus on providing suggestions that exhibit some diversity by using a k-means clustering-based approach. We have evaluated the usability of GameRecs in terms of the user profile generation and the produced video game recommendations, both for single users and for groups. For group recommendations we compared two recommendation aggregation methods, Borda Count and Least Misery method.

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become useful sources of structured data for information retrieval and data analytics tasks. Enabling complex analytics, however, requires entities in KGs to be represented in a way that is suitable for Machine Learning tasks. Several approaches have been recently proposed for obtaining vector representations of KGs based on identifying and extracting relevant graph substructures using both uniform and biased random walks. However, such approaches lead to representations comprising mostly popular, instead of relevant, entities in the KG. In KGs, in which different types of entities often exist (such as in Linked Open Data), a given target entity may have its own distinct set of most relevant nodes and edges. We propose specificity as an accurate measure of identifying most relevant, entity-specific, nodes and edges. We develop a scalable method based on bidirectional random walks to compute specificity. Our experimental evaluation results show that specificity-based biased random walks extract more meaningful (in terms of size and relevance) substructures compared to the state-of-the-art and the graph embedding learned from the extracted substructures perform well against existing methods in common data mining tasks.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a popular tool for recommendation systems. However, collaborative filtering technologies often suffer from high time complexity, the cold-start problem, and low coverage. Recent research shows that social networks and trust-aware methods can effectively solve these problems. Therefore, we propose a Trust Domain Expert Collaborative Filtering recommendation system. First, we divide the user item rating matrix into multiple sub-matrices based on the domain attributes of each item. For each sub-matrix, we then use domain experts to construct a user-expert trust matrix. Finally, combined with the target user's domain of interest, we predict their missing ratings. Experimental results show that this method not only improves the accuracy and recommended coverage of collaborative filtering-based methods, but also reduces the computation time.},

Recommender systems that facilitate serendipitous recommendations create what are considered to be beyond-accuracy experiences. Because serendipitous recommendations are unexpected, users may experience some trust issues with the recommender system. This paper reports on the use of transparency for connection-making (a process/stage of serendipitous experience) in serendipity recommendations generation and examines trust with respect to an interactive serendipitous recommender system. We developed a user interface for JabRef (related work tab). The experiment studied the responses of users, comprised of undergraduate students, in a university environment. Data was collected for both subjective and objective evaluations. The analysis was used to determine the significance and impact of transparency in recommender systems in which serendipitous recommendations are generated. The results showed that greater transparency has a positive impact on user experience, helps with connection-making, and enhances the trust of learners who use recommender systems for learning purposes. Such systems can be used by faculty members and students during research and supervision in order to facilitate finding new research topics and trust in such systems.},

Social relations, such as trust or friend relationships, are used as complement source to user feedback data (e.g. item rating). However, using explicitly issued social relations directly may generate sub-optional recommendation results because of the inherent drawbacks of explicit social relations. To address the inherent drawbacks of explicit social relation, we incorporate top-k implicit friends, who can be identified from a heterogeneous information network established by user feedback and user social relation data, into a matrix factorization method to make social recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets FilmTrust and Douban show that our method can improve the performance of rating prediction, compared to the social recommender systems using explicit social relation and non-social recommender system.},

Current works do not provide a perspective of the many variables involved in the user perception of several aspects of the system such as domain knowledge, relevance, explainability, and trust. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by studying three interfaces, with different levels of explainability, for artistic image recommendation. Our experiments with N=121 users confirm that explanations of recommendations in the image domain are useful and increase user satisfaction, perception of explainability and relevance. Furthermore, our results show that the observed effects are also dependent on the underlying recommendation algorithm used. We tested two algorithms: Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which has high accuracy, and Attractiveness Visual Features (AVF) with high transparency but lower accuracy. Our results indicate that algorithms should not be studied in isolation, but rather in conjunction with interfaces, since both play a significant role in the perception of explainability and trust for image recommendation. Finally, using the framework by Knijnenburg et al., we provide a comprehensive model which synthesizes the effects between different variables involved in the user experience with explainable visual recommender systems of artistic images.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the purchase of every product involves a lot of critical thinking. Every buyer goes through a lot of user reviews and rating before finalizing his purchase. They do this to ensure that the product they purchase is of good quality at minimum price possible. It is evident now that online reviews are not that reliable because of fake reviews and review bots. Now you can even pay certain social media groups to give your product a fake good rating. Hence going just with the reviews of some stranger whom you do not know is not intelligent. So we propose a recommendation model based on the Trust Relations (TR) and User Credibility (UC) because it is human nature that a person feels more comfortable when he gets a review from a person he knows on a first name basis. Also, the credibility of the reviewer is an important factor while providing importance to the reviews because every person is different from other and can have different expertise. Our model takes into account the effect of credibility which is not used by any other recommendations models which increases the precision of the results of our model. We also propose the algorithm to calculate the credibility of any node in the network. The results are validated using a dataset and applying our proposed model and traditional average rating model which shows that our model performs better and gives precise results.},

abstract = {Online movies' recommender systems aim to address the information explosion of movies and make the personalized recommendation for users. Recently, knowledge graphs have been proven to be highly effective to recommender systems, because they are able to fuse various recommendation models and can handle the issues of data sparsity and cold start to improve recommendation performance. However, less consideration is given to the information about the user's properties than the item's properties in the existing knowledge graph recommendation methods, which leads to some limitations in the recommendation results. In this paper, we propose HI2Rec, which integrates multiple information to learn the user's and item's vector representations for top-N recommendation to address the above-mentioned issues. We extract the movie-related information from the Linked Open Data and then leverage the knowledge representation learning approach to embed this information as well as real-world datasets' information of recommender systems to a unified vector space. These vector representations are further calculated to generate a preliminary recommendation list. Finally, we utilize a collaborative filter approach to generate a precision recommendation list. The experimental results on the real-world datasets demonstrate that HI2Rec gives substantial performance improvements against the state-of-the-art recommendation models.},

abstract = {Increase in chronic diseases among people gives the health care industry a challenging problem. Healthcare industry is using the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to create systems that monitor patients. The ultimate task of the system is to minimize manual efforts made to recommend food and drugs for chronic patients. However, many uncertain factors are involved with chronic patients, and existing models unable to handle it efficiently often lead to poor results. Medical records gathered from diverse devices, such as mobile and IoT devices that are raw in nature or in different formats cannot be utilized for further analysis. Since patient records grow rapidly, it is difficult for health care systems to manage and control. To overcome these limitations, the proposed system develops a fuzzy ontology-based recommender system using Type-2 fuzzy logic to recommend foods and drugs for chronic (diabetic) patient. Extraction of risk factors for chronic patients is achieved via wearable sensors and IoT-based electronic medical records are linked with linked open data (LOD) to create a knowledge base. Since, patient data sets are huge; cloud services are used to store and retrieve data for further analysis. An experiment is conducted on patient datasets and the results illustrate that the proposed work is efficient for patient data enrichment, risk factor extraction and appropriate medical advice for chronic patients.},

However, most of the existing tools require features in propositional form, i.e., a vector of nominal or numerical features associated with an instance, while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature. In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. We evaluate our approach on three different tasks: (i) standard machine learning tasks, (ii) entity and document modeling, and (iii) content-based recommender systems. The evaluation shows that the proposed entity embeddings outperform existing techniques, and that pre-computed feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.},

In this paper, we propose a network representation learning enhanced recommendation algorithm. Specifically, we first adopt a network representation technique to embed social network into a low-dimensional space, and then utilize the low-dimensional representations of users to infer fine-grained and dense trust relationships between users. Finally, we integrate the fine-grained and dense trust relationships into the matrix factorization model to learn user and item latent feature vectors.

abstract = {Nowadays, the transition of the customers' desire to move forward from traditional to intelligent systems has caused rising trends of Ecommerce businesses. This can bring lots of opportunities and challenges for internet businesses to absorb the customer desire in a competitive manner. In this regard, recommender systems help users to find and select their desired items. These systems cannot recommend without having enough information about users and their desired items such as film, music, book. One of the main goals in these systems is to collect various information about user interest and available items of the system. Most of these systems operate based on collaborative filtering method in which similarity measures are used to select similar neighbors for a user and then the recommendation is offered based on the evaluation of their comments. In this paper, a recommender system using GMDH Neural Network algorithm is proposed to recommend films to users. The proposed model is based on exploring implicit trust from active users' rates. Implicit trust networks among users are used to reduce prediction error of the improved user-oriented collaborative filtering algorithm. GMDH Neural Network offers a high learning speed even when there are few numbers of training data due to using the evolutionary genetic algorithm for the optimal design of the network structure. The proposed model is implemented using GevoM on MovieLens datasets and the results are compared with other algorithms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that the proposed model outperforms other algorithms like MLP, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian, J48, Bagging, SMO, RBF network, Logistic, and Random Forest with precision of 76% and absolute mean error of 0.273.},

In this work, we propose an intelligent user interface for security analysts that recommends what data to protect, visualizes simulated protection impact, and helps build protection plans. In a domain with limited access to expert users and practices, we elicited user requirements from security analysts in industry and modeled data risks based on architectural and conceptual attributes. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that the design improves the understanding and trust of the recommended protections and helps convert risk information in protection plans.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been increasingly used in online services that we consume daily, such as Facebook, Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify. However, these systems are often presented to users as a “black box”, i.e. the rationale for providing individual recommendations remains unexplained to users. In recent years, various attempts have been made to address this black box issue by providing textual explanations or interactive visualisations that enable users to explore the provenance of recommendations. Among other things, results demonstrated benefits in terms of precision and user satisfaction. Previous research had also indicated that personal characteristics such as domain knowledge, trust propensity and persistence may also play an important role on such perceived benefits. Yet, to date, little is known about the effects of personal characteristics on explaining recommendations. To address this gap, we developed a music recommender system with explanations and conducted an online study using a within-subject design. We captured various personal characteristics of participants and administered both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Results indicate that personal characteristics have significant influence on the interaction and perception of recommender systems, and that this influence changes by adding explanations. For people with a low need for cognition are the explained recommendations the most beneficial. For people with a high need for cognition, we observed that explanations could create a lack of confidence. Based on these results, we present some design implications for explaining recommendations.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems for online marketing often rely on users' ratings to evaluate the similarity between users in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems. This paper applies knowledge-based evolutionary optimization algorithms called Cultural Algorithms (CA) to evaluate the similarity between users. To deal with the sparsity of data, we combine CF with a trust network between users. The trust network is then clustered using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which helps to discover the top neighbors' trust value. By incorporating trust relationships with CF, we predict the rating by each user on a given item. This study uses the Epinions dataset in order to train and test the accuracy of the results of the approach. The results are then compared against those produced by Genetic Algorithms (GA), Cosine, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) methods. The comparison of the results suggests that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other similarity functions.},

Evaluation on the MovieLens 1M dataset shows that the linear normalisation approach yields a significant increase in recommendation accuracy as compared to the default case, especially in settings where the most popular movies are omitted. These results serve as a fruitful base for further incorporation of graph measures into recommender systems, and might help in establishing the recommendation diversity that has recently gained much attention.},

@article{Musto2019,
abstract = {In this article we propose a framework that generates natural language explanations supporting the suggestions generated by a recommendation algorithm. The cornerstone of our approach is the usage of Linked Open Data (LOD) for explanation aims. Indeed, the descriptive properties freely available in the LOD cloud (e.g., the author of a book or the director of a movie) can be used to build a graph that connects the recommendations the user received to the items she previously liked via the properties extracted from the LOD cloud. In a nutshell, our approach is based on the insight that properties describing the items the user previously liked as well as the suggestions she received can be effectively used to explain the recommendations. Such a framework is both algorithm-independent and domain-independent, thus it can generate a natural language explanation for every kind of recommendation algorithm, and it can be used to explain a single recommendation (Top-1 scenario) as well as a group of recommendations (Top-N scenario). It is worth noting that the algorithm-independent characteristic does not mean that the framework is able to explain to the user how the recommendations have been generated and how the recommendation algorithm works. The framework explains to users why they might like the recommended items, independently from the recommendation algorithm that generated the recommendations. In the experimental evaluation, we carried out a user study (N = 680) aiming to investigate the effectiveness of our framework in three different domains, as movies, books and music. Results showed that our technique leads to transparent explanations for all the domains, and such explanations resulted independent of the specific recommendation algorithm in most of the experimental settings. Moreover, we also showed the goodness of our strategy when an entire group of recommendations has to be explained. As a case study, we integrated the framework in a real-world application, a conversational recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot. The idea is to use the explanation for supporting both the training phase (when the user expresses her preferences) and the recommendation step (when the user receives the recommendations). Interesting outcomes emerge from these preliminary experiments.},

In this paper, we solve these weaknesses by comparing the main ten non-personalized strategies on a fair ground, by simulating them against two datasets and using seven of the mostly agreed upon metrics.

Traditional algorithms such as collaborative filtering and matrix decomposition are widely used in actual production environments.

Moreover, it is difficult for existing methods to ensure the presentation quality of the explanations (e.g., consistency). To solve these problems, we design a reinforcement learning framework for explainable recommendation. Our framework can explain any recommendation model (model-agnostic) and can flexibly control the explanation quality based on the application scenario. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we show how it can be used for generating sentence-level explanations. Specifically, we instantiate the explanation generator in the framework with a personalized-attention-based neural network. Offline experiments demonstrate that our method can well explain both collaborative filtering methods and deep-learning-based models. Evaluation with human subjects shows that the explanations generated by our method are significantly more useful than the explanations generated by the baselines.},

Thus, recommender systems based on user understanding are urgently in need. Different from the traditional techniques that usually focus on individual users, the social-based recommender systems perform better with integrating social influence modeling to achieve more accurate user profiling. However, current works usually generalize influence in simple mode, while deep discussions on intrinsic mechanism have been largely ignored. To solve this problem, this paper studies the social influence within users who affects both rating and user attributes, and then proposes a novel trust-driven PMF (TPMF) algorithm to merge these two mechanisms. Furthermore, to deal with the task that different user should have personalized parameters, the study clusters users according to rating correlation and then maps them to corresponding weights, thereby achieving the personalized selection of users' model parameters. Comprehensive experiments on open data sets validate that TPMF and its derivation algorithm can effectively predict users' rating compared with several state of the art baselines, which demonstrates the capability of the presented influence mechanism and technical framework.},

abstract = {As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering provides a useful recommendation by associating an active user with a crowd of users who share the same interests. Although some achievements have been achieved both in theory and practice, the efficiency of recommender systems has been negatively affected by the problems of cold start and data sparsity recently. To solve the above problems, the trust relationship among users is employed into recommender systems to build a learning model to further promote the prediction quality and users' satisfaction. However, most of the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms fail to take into account the fact that users with different levels of trust and backgrounds, that is, user's social status and homophily have different degrees of influence on their friends. In this paper, a novel social matrix factorization-based recommendation method is proposed to improve the recommendation quality by fusing user's social status and homophily. User's social status and homophily play important roles in improving the performance of recommender systems. We first build a user's trust relationship network based on user social relationships and the rating information. Then, the degree of trust is calculated through the trust propagation method and the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the trust relationship is integrated into the matrix factorization model to accurately predict unknown ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using real-life datasets including the Epinions and Douban datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms.},

The central tenet of repeatability is operationalised by transparently reporting methodological activities in detail, such that all actions could be replicated and verified. To date, evidence synthesis has only partially embraced Open Science, typically striving for Open Methodology and Open Access, and occasionally providing sufficient information to be considered to have Open Data for some published reviews. Evidence synthesis communities needs to better embrace Open Science not only to balance knowledge access and increase efficiency, but also to increase reliability, trust and reuse of information collected and synthesised within a review: concepts fundamental to systematic reviews and maps.

However, users usually do not know the Quality of Service (QoS) of all candidate services. Therefore, the prediction of QoS based on the historical records of the Web services has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. The traditional prediction methods based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) have been successfully employed by some studies to address the Web service prediction problem. However, these methods usually suffer from the problems such as data sparseness and user trust, which may cause poor performance even failures of Web service QoS prediction. In the recent literature, the random walk algorithm is successfully applied to the recommendation models, which can effectively solve the data sparse problem. However, the performance of recommendation accuracy is not ideal, especially when it applied to the user-service classic recommendation model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a service quality prediction method based on the covering random walk algorithm, which is a random walk model that takes into account the influence of trust between users and users on Web service prediction, and the method employs a covering algorithm to find trust users. The clustering method does not require the number of clusters to be pre-specified or the initial centers to be manually selected, thus it can ensure the stability of the prediction. Firstly, the proposed method, based on the QoS records of user service history, employs an improved covering algorithm to cluster the users, and the Top-k users who are clustered with each user are selected as trusted users of the user, then all users are connected to their trusted users to build a user trust network. Secondly, based on the user trust network, a random walk prediction method is proposed. In the process of the random walk, not only does the QoS information of the target service is considered, but also the QoS information of the similar service is considered. The reason is that the relationship between these users and the source user will become weak and the QoS values obtained will become unreliable when the walks go too far from the source user in the trust network. Finally, a single random walk can only return a QoS value. To acquire more QoS values and obtain a more reliable prediction, several random walks are desirable and integrate all QoS values returned by different random walks for prediction. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, we conducted a large number of experiments in the real Web service datasets, including 1974675 Web service records of 5825 real-world Web services from 339 users. The experimental results show that the proposed method is obviously superior to the existing methods in the prediction accuracy, and it can solve the problems of data sparseness and user trust of the recommended system at the same time.},

We evaluate the trust merits on both the feedback-only methods (direct) and the ratings (indirect) and suggest the use of aging weight, selective historic data, credibility and context to cope with malicious attacks such as colluding, white-washing and oscillation.

abstract = {Web 2.0 technology fosters the flourishing growth and development of social networks. More and more people are participating in the activities on social networks to interact and share information with each other. Thus, consumers are often making their purchasing decisions based on information from the Internet such as reviews, ratings, and comments on products, especially from their trusted friends. However, a great amount of available information may cause the problem of information overload for consumers. In seeking to attain a good recommendation performance by taking the high-potential factors into account as far as possible, this paper proposes a novel social recommendation method on the basis of the integration of interactions, trust relationships and product popularity to predict user preferences, and recommend relevant products in social networks. In addition, the proposed method mainly focuses on analyzing user interactions to infer their latent interactions in accordance with the user ratings and corresponding reviews. Additionally, users may be affected by the popularity of products, so this factor has also been taken into consideration in this work. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation method has a better recommendation performance in comparisons to other methods because the proposed method can accurately analyze user preferences and further recommend high-potential products to target users in social networks to support their purchase decision making. Furthermore, the proposed method can not only reduce the time and effort users spend on querying information, but also positively relieve the problem of information overload.},

In this paper, we investigated two factors thought to influence user trust towards a robot: preference elicitation (a combination of user involvement and explanation) and embodiment. We set our experiment in the application domain of a restaurant recommender system, assessing trust via user decision making and perceived source credibility. Previous research in this area uses simulated environments and recommender systems that present the user with the best choice from a pool of options. This experiment builds on past work in two ways: first, we strengthened the ecological validity of our experimental paradigm by incorporating perceived risk during decision making; and second, we used a system that recommends a nonoptimal choice to the user. While no effect of embodiment is found for trust, the inclusion of preference elicitation features significantly increases user trust towards the robot recommender system. These findings have implications for marketing and health promotion in relation to Human-Robot Interaction and call for further investigation into the development and maintenance of trust between robot and user.},

The model takes the mutual influence of evolutive trust-rating over time into account. When recommending an item for a given user, we can update the ratings and trust values on the current time dynamically, and then perform random walk to rank Top-N items.

Due to the sparse nature of these networks, trust information between any two users may not be always available. To infer the missing trust values, one well-known approach is path based trust estimation, which suggests a user to believe all of its neighbors in the network. In this context, we propose two threshold-based heuristics to overcome the limitation of computation for the path based trust inference. It uses the propagation phenomena of trust and decides a threshold value to select a subset of users for trust propagation. While the first heuristic creates the inferred network considering only the subset of users, the second one is able to preserve the density of the inferred network coming from all users selection. We implement the heuristics and analyze the inferred networks with two real-world datasets. We observe that the proposed threshold based heuristic can recover up to 70 % of the paths with much less time compared to its deterministic counterpart. We also show that the heuristic based inferred trust is capable of preserving the recommendation accuracy.},

Digital service providers have increasingly been interested in the possibilities of innovating new ideas and services around open data. Digital service ecosystems provide several advantages for service developers, enabling the service co-innovation and co-creation among ecosystem members utilizing and sharing common assets and knowledge. The utilization of open data in digital services requires new innovation practices, service development models, and a collaboration environment. These can be provided by the ecosystem. However, since open data can be almost anything and originate from different kinds of data sources, the quality of data becomes the key issue. The new challenge for service providers is how to guarantee the quality of open data. In the ecosystems, uncertain data quality poses major challenges. The main contribution of this paper is the concept of the Evolvable Open Data based digital service Ecosystem (EODE), which defines the kinds of knowledge and services that are required for validating open data in digital service ecosystems. Thus, the EODE provides business potential for open data and digital service providers, as well as other actors around open data. The ecosystem capability model, knowledge management models, and the taxonomy of services to support the open data quality certification are described. Data quality certification confirms that the open data is trustworthy and its quality is good enough to be accepted for the usage of the ecosystem's services. The five-phase open data quality certification process, according to which open data is brought to the ecosystem and certified for the usage of the digital service ecosystem members using the knowledge models and support services of the ecosystem, is also described. The initial experiences of the still ongoing validation steps are summarized, and the concept limitations and future development targets are identified.},

Recommender systems offer personalized recommendations and help individuals overcome this information overload. The deployment of such systems in the hotel industry needs to satisfy specific constraints making the direct application of classical approaches insufficient. Travelers recurrently fall into the cold-start status due to the volatility of interest and the change in attitudes depending on the context. Events have been playing an essential role in drawing attention to specific regions and constitute a major motive to organize trips. In this paper, we explore for the first time the benefits of introducing open data related to events into hotel recommender systems. We address in particular two problems, the hotel-centric and the event-centric problems, where we recommend pairs of hotels and events in order to facilitate the tourism planning and enhance the travelers' experience. We first collect data related to events and filter those susceptible of attracting people. We then develop a novel framework that infers events' affinities based on hotel booking data and rely on the mass behavior to make personalized suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by performing a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation. Improvements in the quality of recommendation show the advantage of leveraging event data for hotel recommendation and illustrate the opportunities of using open data for tourism planning.},

Specifically, they could be used in an academic environment with the aim of improving the educational processes, not replacing, but complementing the most traditional face-to-face models. But nowadays the increasingly widespread use of new technologies and social networks is causing the information we have available to grow disproportionately, making it more difficult and expensive to access information of interest. To alleviate this problem, automatic tools such as recommender systems, could be used to facilitate the accesses to relevant information, that in an academic environment would help to customize the educational processes. So, in this paper we present SharingNotes, an academic social network that can generate personalized recommendations to improve teaching and learning processes. To achieve this goal, it incorporates a hybrid recommender system that uses an ontology to characterize the degrees of trust among network users, and adopts the fuzzy linguistic modeling to improve the representation of information. Then, the use of this platform allows adapting the educational process to the circumstances of each student.

In other words, there may be some users who open fake profiles and vote one-sided or biased in the system that may cause disturbance in providing proper recommendations to other users. This kind of damage is said to be shiling attacks. If the attackers succeed, the user's trust in the recommender systems will reduce.

abstract = {Social recommendation systems use social relations (such as trust, friendship, etc.) among users to find preferences and provide relevant suggestions to users. Historical ratings of items provided by the users are also used to predict unseen items in the systems. Therefore, it is an important issue to calculate the sufficient number of the historical ratings for each user to have a reliable prediction. In addition, providing a reliable mechanism to incorporate virtual ratings into the historical ratings of the users who have insufficient ratings can improve the performance of the rating prediction process. In this paper, a social recommendation system is proposed based on reliable virtual ratings to improve the accuracy of predicted ratings especially about the users with insufficient ratings. To this end, a probabilistic mechanism is used to calculate the minimum number of required ratings for each user to predict unseen items with high reliability. Then, a novel method is considered to predict the reliable virtual ratings based on users' reputation and clustering models. In addition, a noise detection method is used to detect noisy virtual ratings and prevent them from adding to the historical ratings. Then, the reliability, diversity and novelty of items are used to propose a selection mechanism for adding the remaining virtual ratings into historical ratings of the users with insufficient ratings. Therefore, the performance of the social recommendation systems can be improved through incorporating the reliable virtual ratings. Several experiments are performed based on three well-known datasets and the results show that the proposed method achieves higher performance than other state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

abstract = {User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular approaches to create recommender systems. This approach is based on finding the most relevant k users from whose rating history we can extract items to recommend. CF, however, suffers from data sparsity and the cold-start problem since users often rate only a small fraction of available items. One solution is to incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust relationships that result from social connections between users. Such relationships typically form a very sparse trust network, which can be utilized to generate recommendations for users based on people they trust. In our work, we explore the use of regular equivalence applied to a trust network to generate a similarity matrix that is used to select the k-nearest neighbors for recommending items. We evaluate our approach on Epinions and we find that we can outperform related methods for tackling cold-start users in terms of recommendation accuracy.},

abstract = {In crowdsourcing contest, effective task recommendation becomes an urgent problem to be solved. The traditional task recommendation only builds the task recommendation method based on the worker's bidding record of the task, but the worker's bidding on the task is essentially determined by the willingness of the worker to participate. Considered the characteristics of crowdsourcing contest, a task recommendation method based on influencing factors of crowdsourcing contest participating willingness is proposed. Based on previous researches on the influencing factors of participating willingness, the influencing factors of workers' participating willingness are described as workers' preference on profits, ability and their trust in requesters. According to the behavior history of workers and related information, each dimension of the influencing factors is measured. Then, we formulate the worker model and generate recommendation list using collaborative filtering algorithm with the similarity degree of influencing factors. The numeral experiments on real data from epwk. com indicate that this method has better performance on the task recommendation of crowdsourcing contest.},

abstract = {Purpose: The advance of technology creates new possibilities for enhancing shopper experience. The purpose of this paper is to gain understanding of a recent innovation found in retail environment, a recommender system (RS). Specifically, this study investigated how the retailer's claims of RS affect consumers' perception of personalization, and further, trusting beliefs and intentions. Additionally, the effect of sponsored recommendation (SR) on consumers' perceived trust was explored. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (RS claim: personalized/non-personalized)×2 (SR: present/absent)×2 (involvement: high/low) between subject factorial design was employed. An online experiment was conducted. A total of 273 response collected through Amazon MTurk were used for the analysis. Findings: The findings showed retailer's claims for RS were enough to increase the perception of personalization. The increased perceived personalization of the RS increased trusting beliefs and trusting intention. For SR, mixed results were found. Disclosing SR increased trusting intentions under the low-involvement condition, but the opposite effect was found under high-involvement condition. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of retailers' articulating what RS does. This can impact trusting beliefs and trusting intention. Additionally, the findings indicate SRs should be presented in accordance to the decision-making stage. The presence of SRs during the searching stage may positively impact consumer's perception, but their presence during purchase stage may have a negative impact. Originality/value: This study is among the first to examine the effect of different retailer's claims on how the recommendations are generated on shopper's perception. Also, this is one of few studies to investigate how SRs in RSs impact a shopper's perception. This research provides insights into how an RS found in retail environment influence shopping experience.},

As a solution to overcome many of these limitations current paper studies a novel method to infer trust relationships. The method is based on the triadic closure mechanism, which is a fundamental mechanism of link formation in social networks via which communities emerge naturally, especially when the network is very sparse. Additionally, a method called JaccardCoefficient is proposed to calculate the trust weight of the inferred relationships based on the Jaccard Coefficient similarity measure.

Ratings are predicted on the healthcare services by merging recommendations given by users who has social relations with the active users. However, existing works did not consider the influence of distrust between users. They recommend items only based on the trust relations between users. We therefore propose a novel deep learning-based socialized healthcare service recommender model, which recommends healthcare services with recommendations given by recommenders with both trust relations and distrust relations with the active users. The influences of recommenders, considering both the node information and the structure information, are merged via the deep learning model.

abstract = {The quality of recommendations based on any class of recommender systems may become poor if no or low quality data has been provided by users. This is a situation known as Cold Start problem, which typically happens when a new user registers to the system and no preference data is available for that user. Trust-Aware Recommendation Systems can be considered as a solution for the cold start problem. In these systems, the trust between users plays an import role for making recommendations. However, most of the Trust-Aware RSs consider trust as a context independent phenomenon which means if user a trusts user b to the degree k then user a trusts user b to the degree k in all the concepts. However, in reality, trust is context dependent and user a can trust user b in context X but not in Y. Moreover, most of the trust-aware RSs do not consider an expertise concept for users and all the users are considered as same in the recommendation process. In this paper we proposed a novel approach for detecting expert users just based on their ratings (unlike previous systems which consider the separate profile and extra information for each user to find an expert). In this model a supervised random walk is exploited to search the trust network for finding experts. Empirical experiments on the Epinions dataset shows that EXTRA can outperform previous models in terms of accuracy and coverage.},

Specifically, a tunable parameter is used to scale the resources received by trusted users before the redistribution back to the objects. Interestingly, we find an optimal scaling parameter for the proposed CosRA+T method to achieve its best recommendation accuracy, and the optimal value seems to be universal under several evaluation metrics across different datasets. Moreover, results of extensive experiments on the two real-world rating datasets with trust relations, Epinions and FriendFeed, suggest that CosRA+T has a remarkable improvement in overall accuracy, diversity and novelty.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively learn directive trust strength to improve trust-aware recommender systems. Advancing previous works, we propose to establish direction of trust strength by modeling the implicit relationships between users with roles of trusters and trustees. Specially, under new trust strength with directions, how to compute the directive trust strength is becoming a new challenge. Therefore, we present a novel method to adaptively learn directive trust strengths in a unified framework by enforcing the trust strength into range of [0, 1] through a mapping function.

This paper builds a dichotomy model of shareholder-stock relationship based on the distributed graph computing framework Spark GraphX, and using a certain financial theory, transforms the investment behavior of users (shareholders) into the ratings and trust of the invested stock. Then we calculate the shareholder similarity graph and the trust graph of shareholders through the parallel graph calculation, and use the improved collaborative filtering algorithm based on trust model to make a recommendation analysis of the stock of A-shares and SME stocks in the stock market. Finally, the comparison of common collaborative filtering algorithm in the experimental environment shows that the system has better algorithm scalability and accuracy.},

abstract = {The widescale use of machine learning algorithms to drive decision-making has highlighted the critical importance of ensuring the interpretability of such models in order to engender trust in their output. The state-of-the-art recommendation systems use black-box latent factor models that provide no explanation of why a recommendation has been made, as they abstract their decision processes to a high-dimensional latent space which is beyond the direct comprehension of humans. We propose a novel approach for extracting explanations from latent factor recommendation systems by training association rules on the output of a matrix factorisation black-box model. By taking advantage of the interpretable structure of association rules, we demonstrate that predictive accuracy of the recommendation model can be maintained whilst yielding explanations with high fidelity to the black-box model on a unique industry dataset. Our approach mitigates the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff whilst avoiding the need to sacrifice flexibility or use external data sources. We also contribute to the ill-defined problem of evaluating interpretability.},

abstract = {Due to limitations and challenges faced by traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems, researchers have been shifting their attention towards using trust information among users while generating recommendations. It is observed that one trust metric may work better for some user and fails to do so in the case of another user. This paper proposes to favor that metric which provides high-quality recommendations for a particular user. For this purpose, weights have been assigned to various trust metrics for each pair of users and optimized iteratively to generate more accurate and personalized recommendations. We have used swarm intelligent techniques namely Bat algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for the same. The performance of the approach proposed in this work is evaluated using MovieLens, Epinions, CiaoDVD, and Filmtrust data sets and compared to earlier works generating recommendations using an individual metric. The results indicate that the MAE while using a combination of weighted trust is 0.59 (with PSO) and 0.55 (with Bat), which is much better compared to using a single metric. Bat also generates better recommendations with an accuracy of 85.45% than PSO (81.85%). Also, the MAE found using Bat was 3.84% better when utilizing denser datasets (MovieLens and FilmTrust) as compared to sparse datasets (CiaoDVD and Epinions).},

There exist a few approaches, which mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users and effectively improve accuracy of rating prediction. However, having users provide explicit trust scores of each other is often full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel method to incorporate both explicit and implicit trust in providing recommendations. First, we use one of Trust Metrics algorithms to compute and predict implicit trust scores between users based on their interactions.

abstract = {As we face a deluge of information in the modern world, the importance of recommender systems (RSs) that recommend relevant items to users has increased. The majority of existing RS schemes observe the prior ratings history of consumers to identify preferred items. However, current RSs suffer from the cold start problem, and their performance is dismal when new users or items appear. In order to address the cold start problem, a new type of solution that exploits social network features has been proposed. Many such social RSs analyze trustor–trustee relationships to discover latent social features shared between trustor and trustee. Since social relationships between trustors and trustees are directed, but not reciprocal, it is not guaranteed that a trustee has features in common with its trustors. Moreover, existing schemes are based on the assumption of independence between trustors who follow the same trustee, and therefore fail to recognize quintessential factors shared by the trustors. We posit that trustors who follow the same trustee have features in common. Based on the assumption that trustors who endorse the same trustee share similar tastes, we propose a new latent feature called Matrix S, and develop two novel RS algorithms that learn these latent features. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation using large scale real-world datasets, and observe that our proposed methods are not only more accurate than existing schemes but also show potential extensibility.},

abstract = {The success of e-commerce companies is becoming increasingly dependent on product recommender systems which have become powerful tools that personalize the shopping experience for users based on user interests and interactions. Most modern recommender systems concentrate on finding the relevant items for each user based on their interests only, and ignore the social interactions among users. Some recommender systems, rely on the ‘trust' of users. However in social science, trust, as a human characteristic, is a complex concept with multiple facets which has not been fully explored in recommender systems. In this paper, to model a realistic and accurate recommender system, we address the problem of social trust modeling where trust values are shaped based users characteristics in a social network. We propose a method that can predict rating for personalized recommender systems based on similarity, centrality and social relationships. Compared with traditional collaborative filtering approaches, the advantage of the proposed mechanism is its consideration of social trust values. We use the probabilistic matrix factorization method to predict user rating for products based on user-item rating matrix. Similarity is modeled using a rating-based (i.e., Vector Space Similarity and Pearson Correlation Coefficient) and connection-based similarity measurements. Centrality metrics are quantified using degree, eigen-vector, Katz and PageRank centralities. To validate the proposed trust model, an Epinions dataset is used and the rating prediction scheme is implemented. Comprehensive analysis shows that the proposed trust model based on similarity and centrality metrics provide better rating prediction rather than using binary trust values. Based on the results, we find that the degree centrality is more effective compared to other centralities in rating prediction using the specific dataset. Also trust model based on the connection-based similarity performs better compared to the Vector Space Similarity and Pearson Correlation Coefficient similarities which are rating based. The experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in further improving the accuracy of rating prediction in social recommender systems.},

In this paper, we use an RS internal trust cluster for the first time to further improve performance and analyze the characteristics of trust clusters. We propose a new approach, a trust-aware network (TAN) RS, to exploit these trust clusters. We also explore the impact and influence of power users in a social network-based RS using TAN RS, and analyze the impact of power users and clusters. From our experiments, we find that the use of TAN RS can enhance the prediction accuracy of RSs; we also show that power users and the sizes of clusters are not significant, and that normal users and ordinary sizes of clusters contribute to a reduction in prediction errors in social RSs.},

Providing more user control is interesting to enable end-users to help steer the recommendation process with additional input and feedback. However, different users may have different preferences with regard to such control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the effect of personal characteristics on visual control techniques in the music recommendation domain. In this paper, we present results of a user study on the web using two different visualisation techniques (a radar chart and sliders) that allows users to control Spotify recommendations. A within-subject design with Latin Square counterbalancing measures was used for the study. Results indicate that the radar chart helped the participants discover a significantly higher number of new songs compared to the sliders. We also found that users' experience with Spotify had an influence on their interaction with different musical attributes. The participants who used Spotify frequently and users with a high individual musical sophistication interacted with the attributes significantly more with the radar chart compared to the sliders. Individual musical sophistication also had a significant impact on their interaction with the interaction techniques. The participants with high musical sophistication interacted significantly more with the radar chart in comparison to the sliders. Based on the feedback from our participants, we provide design suggestions to further improve user control in music recommendation.},

Due to its capability and simplicity, collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for recommender systems. However, CF suffers from three issues which are user cold-start, item cold-start and data sparsity problems. These issues severely degrade the performance of CF. To address these issues, a hybrid collaborative filtering recommendation model, termed TrustCF, is proposed in this paper, based on user-item ratings and trust relations among users. TrustCF integrates ratings from trusted friends and similar users, ratings of similar items, item reputation and user history ratings. In particular, we modify the similarity calculation formula, considering the effect of the number of co-ratings. Trust relations among users are used to make predictions. In this way, TrustCF can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed TrustCF model and show TrustCF has better recommendation accuracy than other five counterparts.},

abstract = {Currently, most of the existing recommendation methods treat social network users equally, which assume that the effect of recommendation on a user is decided by the user's own preferences and social influence. However, a user's own knowledge in a field has not been considered. In other words, to what extent does a user accept recommendations in social networks need to consider the user's own knowledge or expertise in the field. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization recommendation algorithm based on integrating social network information such as trust relationships, rating information of users and users' own knowledge. Specifically, since we cannot directly measure a user's knowledge in the field, we first use a user's status in a social network to indicate a user's knowledge in a field, and users' status is inferred from the distributions of users' ratings and followers across fields or the structure of domain-specific social network. Then, we model the final rating of decision-making as a linear combination of the user's own preferences, social influence and user's own knowledge. Experimental results on real world data sets show that our proposed approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms that do not consider the knowledge level difference between the users.},

We split our features into two classes: classic features, as popularity-based, collaborative and content-based ones, and extended features gathered from the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, as basic ones (i.e. genre of a movie or the writer of a book) and graph-based features calculated on the ground of the different topological characteristics of the tripartite representation connecting users, items and properties in the LOD cloud. In the experimental session we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on varying of different groups of features, and results show that both LOD-based and graph-based features positively affect the overall performance of the algorithm, especially in highly sparse recommendation scenarios.

By detailing how user behaviour in a reviewing platform can be formalised based on both frequency of contributions and personality traits, a module that generates synthetic data for nine types of users was constructed. Similarly, after reviewing various possible types of threats which can generally be expected for a reputation system, a combination of four attacks implying specific user behaviour is outlined. Our experiments showed that even in cases where impressive datasets comprised of millions of entities were used, the system obtains promising execution times. When being faced with attacks, it was additionally validated that malicious users are largely prevented from gaining superior reputation ranks. New directions to improve the system are also given, considering the significant gain in traction for research in the area of integrating social networks, reputation and recommender systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are techniques to make personalized recommendations of items to users. In e-commerce sites and online sharing communities, providing high quality recommendations is an important issue which can help the users to make effective decisions to select a set of items. Collaborative filtering is an important type of the recommender systems that produces user specific recommendations of the items based on the patterns of ratings or usage (e.g. purchases). However, the quality of predicted ratings and neighbor selection for the users are important problems in the recommender systems. Selecting suitable neighbors set for the users leads to improve the accuracy of ratings prediction in recommendation process. In this paper, a novel social recommendation method is proposed which is based on an adaptive neighbor selection mechanism. In the proposed method first of all, initial neighbors set of the users is calculated using clustering algorithm. In this step, the combination of historical ratings and social information between the users are used to form initial neighbors set for the users. Then, these neighbor sets are used to predict initial ratings of the unseen items. Moreover, the quality of the initial predicted ratings is evaluated using a reliability measure which is based on the historical ratings and social information between the users. Then, a confidence model is proposed to remove useless users from the initial neighbors of the users and form a new adapted neighbors set for the users. Finally, new ratings of the unseen items are predicted using the new adapted neighbors set of the users and the top_N interested items are recommended to the active user. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

In this paper, we propose a transitive trust-aware cross-domain recommendation model that incorporates the context dependence and transitivity of social trust relations. First, we construct a different transitive trust network for each single domain. Then, we develop a novel probabilistic matrix factorization model for each domain that utilizes the transitive trust-aware model to mine social trust.

The digitalisation of our society including mobile, wearable and Internet of Things devices and the availability of low-cost sensors opens up new possibilities for mapping human behavior and its context via objective sensor data. However, to gain the full potential of using resources on mapping human behavior requires that data is not collected for single usage. The open data paradigm prescribes a method for going beyond one-time data collection. In this vision abstract, we argue that the open data paradigm also supports increasing the trustworthiness of sensing data about human behavior by providing multiple and multi-modal sources of data that complements each other. This is important to enable trustworthy data-driven decision making on data that is not artificially limited by sensing coverage and accuracy or tampered with. We argue that sharing open data can help avoid these issues by providing more data sources and thereby increase trustworthiness.},

The semantic embeddings generated from heterogeneous knowledge sources combined with user preferences can be used to refine a user's information needs. This representation modeling of users, entities and their associated properties opens up new modalities of interactions for the users to gravitate towards their requirements.

Based on the study of the existing social network recommendation methods, we find there is an abundant information that can be incorporated into probability matrix factorization (PMF) model to handle challenges such as data sparsity in many recommender systems. Therefore, the research put forward a unified social network recommendation framework that combine tags, trust between users, ratings with PMF. The uniformed method is based on three existing recommendation models (SoRecUser, SoRecItem and SoRec), and the complexity analysis indicates that our approach has good effectiveness and can be applied to large-scale datasets.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach among different recommendation techniques. However, CF-based methods usually suffer from limited performance due to the sparsity of rating data. To address such issues, utilizing auxiliary information such as content information and social networks is a very promising approach. This paper proposes an effective Bayesian hierarchical framework called Deep Trust Recommender (DTR), which aims to improve the quality of recommender systems by integrating user-item rating information and social trust network into the embedding representation. Specifically, we first apply deep learning methods like stacked denoising auto-encoders to learn the approximation representation of the users preference from the users trust network, and then take this representation to train with rating information collaboratively.

So, this paper proposes the methods of integration the trust and distrust social relationships, TDUCF1 and TDUCF2, and with the improved cosine similarity, to improve the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, which combined the users' trust and distrust social relationships, and effectively alleviated the sparseness.

abstract = {The growth of Internet commerce has stimulated the use of collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms as recommender systems. A CF algorithm recommends items of interest to the target user by leveraging the votes given by other similar users. In a standard CF framework, it is assumed that the credibility of every voting user is exactly the same with respect to the target user. This assumption is not satisfied and thus may lead to misleading recommendations in many practical applications. A natural countermeasure is to design a trust-aware CF (TaCF) algorithm, which can take account of the difference in the credibilities of the voting users when performing CF. To this end, this paper presents a trust inference approach, which can predict the implicit trust of the target user on every voting user from a sparse explicit trust matrix. Then an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace is proposed, which takes advantage of both the explicit and the predicted implicit trust to provide recommendations with the CF framework. An empirical evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in recommendation quality in terms of mean absolute error.},

However, it is faced with the problem of several issues such as data sparsity, extensibility and cold start which affect the effectiveness of the recommendation algorithm in some practical application scenarios. To address the user cold start problem, by merging social trust information (i.e., trusted neighbors explicitly specified by users) and rating information, a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on information of community experts is proposed in this paper. First of all, users are divided into different communities based on their social relations. Then, experts in each community are identified according to some criteria. In addition, in order to alleviate the impact of the data sparsity, ratings of an expert's trusted neighbors are merged to complement the ratings of the expert. Finally, the prediction for a given item is generated by aggregating the ratings of experts in the community of the target user. Experimental results based on two real-world data sets FilmTrust and Epinions show the proposed algorithm is able to alleviate the user cold start problem and superior to other algorithms in terms of MAE and RMSE.},

However, in real world, trust data is sparse in nature. So, many algorithms are built for inferring trust. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference method based on the implicit influence information available in the existing trust network. This approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we define a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global influence in the inferred trust. This process improves the recommendation accuracy from the existing trust-based recommendation and neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. Due to the availability of users preference from trust network which is absent in rating data, it also alleviates the very well-known cold start users problem of a recommender system. We evaluate the proposed approach on two established real world datasets and report the obtained results.},

The scientific community is striving to enhance the quality of life by breaking innovative barriers and developing solutions that had never previously been considered.

However, efforts to seek such co-authors not only are challenging but also occasionally yield no significant results.

Most existing research examines trust in automation for high-risk domains as well as vast recommender systems for low-risk consumer use. This research aims to evaluate human trust in automated decision AIDS for low-risk everyday use, where one automated suggestion is presented and a few alternative options are available. In the current study, we investigate whether anthropomorphic imagery and information reliability can influence perceived trust of the automated decision aid. We report on results from 105 participants, which suggest that levels of semi-Anthropomorphic imagery do not influence trust in the way that a full anthropomorphic image of a human might. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of how to utilize design, specifically visual imagery, to appropriately calibrate trust in automated decision AIDS for everyday use.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering has become one of the most widely used methods for providing recommendations in various online environments. Its recommendation accuracy highly relies on the selection of appropriate neighbors for the target user/item. However, existing neighbor selection schemes have some inevitable inadequacies, such as neglecting users' capability of providing trustworthy recommendations, and ignoring users' preference changes. Such inadequacies may lead to drop of the recommendation accuracy, especially when recommender systems are facing the data sparseness issue caused by the dramatic increase of users and items. To improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a novel two-layer neighbor selection scheme that takes users' capability and trustworthiness into account. In particular, the proposed scheme consists of two modules: (1) capability module that selects the first layer neighbors based on their capability of providing recommendations and (2) a trust module that further identifies the second layer neighbors based on their dynamic trustworthiness on recommendations. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated through experiments on real user datasets. Compared to three existing neighbor selection schemes, the proposed scheme consistently achieves the highest recommendation accuracy across data sets with different degrees of sparseness.},

abstract = {The boom in Linked Open Data (LOD) has recently stimulated the research of a new generation of recommender systems - LOD-enabled recommender systems, in which the similarity measure for LOD is one of the core issues. The partitioned information content (PIC)-based semantic similarity (PICSS) is a newly developed symmetric similarity measure for LOD. However, recent studies have shown that asymmetric similarity measures are more effective than symmetric similarity measures in solving recommendation problems. In this paper we develop an asymmetric item-item similarity measure for LOD - the asymmetric PIC-based semantic similarity measure (APICSS), which applies our proposed two notions: the proportion of common PIC between two resources in the PIC of a resource and the PIC difference between two resources, on the basis of the notion of PIC. Experimental evaluation with the item-based collaborative filtering method on the MovieLens 100k dataset, the DBpedia 2016-04 release, and the DBpedia-MovieLens 100k dataset shows that our APICSS measure outperforms the PICSS measure in terms of both Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The average RMSE accuracy has an increase of 1.58% and the maximum RMSE accuracy has an increase of 2.07%, compared to PICSS.

One way to solve this problem is to construct a recommendation system. Selecting a set of users called neighbor user set and then generating the recommended services through collaborative filtering is a commonly used method to implement a recommendation system. In the recommended process, the user reputation is always considered since we prone to trust the users with high reputation. However, the current recommendation System lacks detailed context information analysis in user reputation calculation. In this paper, we propose a context-aware reputation calculation method based on user ratings. We first propose a novel method to analysis the impact of different contexts on user ratings. Then, we apply the context information of target user to obtain neighbor user set. Finally, we generate services for target user based on his neighbor user set. Experiments show that our method has better accuracy than other traditional methods.},

Recent research has experimentally disclosed the realization of such objectives at the expense of decreasing the recommendations coverage. In this paper, we prove that the rate of coverage shows a monotonic decreasing trend as the number of clusters increases. This proof establishes a foundation for the proposal of a 2D-Graph clustering method for partitioning a novel 2D-Graph in compliance with the minimum-acceptable-rate-of-coverage criterion. To reduce the negative impact of clustering on the coverage in the proposed method, in addition to the information of trust, Pearson similarity is incorporated to construct double-weighted connections between users in the 2D-Graph. In each cluster, to address the sparsity problem, the weights corresponding to a convex combination of Pearson, trust and Jaccard similarities are determined so that the precision is optimized. The experimental results on two real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for Cold Start users in terms of accuracy and coverage.},

abstract = {There are vast amounts of information in our world. Accessing the most accurate information in a speedy way is becoming more difficult and complicated. A lot of relevant information gets ignored which leads to much duplication of work and effort. The focuses tend to provide rapid and intelligent retrieval systems. Information retrieval (IR) is the process of searching for information that is related to some topics of interest. Due to the massive search results, the user will normally have difficulty in identifying the relevant ones. To alleviate this problem, a recommendation system is used. A recommendation system is a sort of filtering information system, which predicts the relevance of retrieved information to the user's needs according to some criteria. Hence, it can provide the user with the results that best fit their needs. The services provided through the web normally provide massive information about any requested item or service. An efficient recommendation system is required to classify this information result. A recommendation system can be further improved if augmented with a level of trust information. That is, recommendations are ranked according to their level of trust. In our research, we produced a recommendation system combined with an efficient level of trust system to guarantee that the posts, comments and feedbacks from users are trusted. We customized the concept of LoT (Level of Trust) [1] since it can cover medical, shopping and learning through social media. The proposed system TRS-LoT provides trusted recommendations to the users with a high percentage of accuracy. Whereas a 300 post with more than 5000 comments from 'Amazon' was selected to be used as a dataset, the experiment has been conducted by using same dataset based on 'post rating'.},

We, accordingly, propose to combine two approaches to improve the recommendation process in tourism domain. The first is the trusted friends' preference based on the assumption that users generally have a tendency to use items recommended by friends rather than strangers. The second is the ontology based user interest to represent the semantics of these interests. A Trusted Friends' Application is developed to determine social trusted friends by analyzing user's profile on Facebook. Afterwards, we have represented the user's model as an ontology that takes into consideration all trusted friends' preferences and the degree of trust between friends. Finally, we have used this ontology in a knowledge-based tourism recommender system as a smart e-tourism tool able to recommend items based on the users' preferences and their trusted friends' preferences.},

Most existing POI recommendation algorithms always employ the check-in data and rich contextual information (e.g., geographical information and users' social network information) of users to learn their preference on POIs. Unfortunately, these studies generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) when modeling geographical influence, users' personalized behavior differences are ignored; (2) when modeling the users' social influence, the implicit social influence is seldom exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel POI recommendation approach called GeoEISo. GeoEISo achieves three key goals in this work. (1) We develop a kernel estimation method with a self-adaptive kernel bandwidth to model the geographical influence between POIs. (2) We use the Gaussian radial basis kernel function based support vector regression (SVR) model to predict explicit trust values between users, and then devise a novel trust-based recommendation model to simultaneously incorporate both the explicit and implicit social trust information into the process of POI recommendation. (3) We develop a unified geo-social framework which combines users' preference on a POI with the geographical influence as well as social correlations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from Foursquare show that GeoEISo provides significantly superior performances compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation models.},

abstract = {Consumer behavior and marketing research have shown that brand has significant influence on product reviews and product purchase decisions. However, there is very little work on incorporating brand related factors into product recommender systems. Meanwhile, the similarity in brand preference between a user and other socially connected users also affects her adoption decisions. To integrate seamlessly the individual and social brand related factors into the recommendation process, we propose a novel model called Social Brand–Item–Topic (SocBIT). As the original SocBIT model does not enforce non-negativity, which poses some difficulty in result interpretation, we also propose a non-negative version, called SocBIT+. Both SocBIT and SocBIT + return not only user topic interest, but also brand-related user factors, namely user brand preference and user brand-consciousness. The former refers to user preference for each brand, the latter refers to the extent to which a user relies on brand to make her adoption decisions. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SocBIT and SocBIT + significantly improve rating prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art models such as Social Regularization Ma et al. (in: ACM conference on web search and data mining (WSDM), 2011), Recommendation by Social Trust Ensemble Ma et al. (in: ACM conference on research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR), 2009a) and Social Recommendation Ma et al. (in: ACM conference on information and knowledge management (CIKM), 2008), which incorporate only the social factors. Specifically, both SocBIT and SocBIT + offer an improvement of at least 22% over these state-of-the-art models in rating prediction for various real-world datasets. Last but not least, our models also outperform the mentioned models in adoption prediction, e.g., they provide higher precision-at-N and recall-at-N.},

Existing recommender systems on the basis of the big social data mostly employ centralized framework, which would cause lots of problems, such as single point failure, communication bottleneck and so on. Some other studies focus on decentralized framework for recommendation, however, most of them concentrate on the improvement of recommendation quality, while underestimating privacy issues, e.g. OSN users' privacy concerns regarding their social relationships, social attributes, and recommendation profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized framework, namely ARMOR, which utilizes OSN users' social attributes and trust relationships to achieve the friend recommendation in a privacy-preserving manner. In ARMOR, we adopt a light-weight privacy-preserving protocol to aggregate the utilities of multi-hop trust chains and compute the recommender results securely. We also analyze the efficiency of ARMOR in theory and prove that OSN users' privacy can be preserved. Finally, we conduct an experiment to evaluate ARMOR over a real-world dataset and empirical results demonstrate that our ARMOR can effectively and efficiently recommend friends in a privacy-preserving way.},

abstract = {A few years ago, the Internet of (Web) Service vision came to offer services to all aspects of life and business. The increasing number of Web services make service recommendation a directive research to help users discover services. Furthermore, the rapid development of social network has accelerated the development of social recommendation approach to avoid the data sparsity and cold-start problems that are not treated very well in the collaborative filtering approach. On the one hand, the pervasive use of the social media provides a big social information about the users (e.g., personnel data, social activities, relationships). Hence, the use of trust relation becomes a necessity to filter and select only the useful information. Several trust-aware service recommender systems have been proposed in literature but they do not consider the time in trust level detection among users. On the other hand, in the reality, the majority of users prefer the advice not only of their trusted friends but also their expertise in some domain-specific. In fact, the taking into account of user's expertise in recommendation step can resolve the user's disorientation problem. For these reasons, we present, in this paper, a Web service decentralized discovery approach which is based on two complementary mechanisms. The trust detection is the first mechanism to detect the social trust level among users. This level is defined in terms of the users' interactions for a period of time and their interest similarity which are inferred from their social profiles. The service recommendation is the second mechanism which combines the social and collaborative approaches to recommend to the active user the appropriate services according to the expertise level of his most trustworthy friends. This level is extracted from the friends' past invocation histories according to the domain-specific which is known in advance in the target user's query. Performance evaluation shows that each proposed mechanism achieves good results. The proposed Level of social Trust (LoT) metric gives better precision more than 50% by comparing with the same metric without taking into account the time factor. The proposed service recommendation mechanism which based on the trust and the domain-specific expertise gives, firstly, a RMSE value lower than other trust-aware recommender systems like TidalTrust, MoleTrust and TrustWalker.

We name this degradation as the sparse trust problem, which will cause the decrease of the recommendation accuracy rate. To address this problem we propose a novel sparse trust mining method, which is based on the Roundtable Gossip Algorithm (RGA). First, we define the relevant representation of sparse trust, which provides a research idea to solve the problem of sparse evidence in the large-scale recommendation system. Based on which the RGA is proposed for mining latent sparse trust relationships between entities in large-scale recommendation systems. Second, we propose an efficient and simple anti-sparsification method, which overcomes the disadvantages of random trust relationship propagation and Grade Inflation caused by different users have different standard for item rating. Finally, the experimental results show that our method can effectively mine new trust relationships and mitigate the sparse trust problem.},

Among the widely known approaches are Content Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). Based on literatures, CF with users rating element has been widely used but the approach faced two common problems namely cold start and sparsity. As an alternative, Trust Aware Recommender Systems (TARS) for the CF based users rating has been introduced. The research progress on TARS improvement is found to be rapidly progressing but lacking in the algorithm evaluation has been started to appear. Many researchers that introduced their new TARS approach provides different evaluation of users' views for the TARS performances. As a result, the performances of different TARS from different publications are not comparable and difficult to be analyzed. Therefore, this paper is written with objective to provide common group of the users' views based on trusted users in TARS. Then, this paper demonstrates a comparison study between different TARS techniques with the identified common groups by means of the accuracy error, rating and users coverage. The results therefore provide a relative comparison between different TARS.},

Indeed, many of the MOOC learners can not appropriate the information they receive and must therefore be assisted in order to not abandon the course. Thus, to help these learners take advantage of the course they follow, we propose a tool to recommend to each of them an ordered list of “Leader learners” who are able to support him throughout his navigation in the MOOC environment. The recommendation phase is based on a multicriteria decision making approach to weekly predict the set of “Leader learners”. Moreover, since the MOOC learners' profiles are very heterogeneous, we recommend to each of them the leaders who are most appropriate to his profile in order to ensure a good understanding between them. The recommendation we propose is validated on real data coming from a French MOOC and has proved satisfactory results.},

The recommendation generation process includes Random Walk with Restart (RWR) alongside Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods. Some parameters were introduced in the system to control weight contribution of each method. A comprehensive experiment with a set of a real-world open data set in two areas, social bookmark (Delicious.com) and music sharing (Last.fm) to test the proposed hybrid recommender system. The outcomes exhibit that it can give improvement compared to an existing method in terms of accuracy.

However, existing works did not consider the influence of distrust between users. They recommend items only base on the trust relations between users.

Although the hybrid user similarity model recently proposed by the academic community is suitable for a sparse user-item matrix and can effectively improve recommendation accuracy, it relies solely on the historical data (item ratings). This work addresses the problem of computing user similarity by combining item ratings and background knowledge from LOD. We propose a computation method for the user similarity based on feature relevance (USFR), which is an improvement on the user similarity based on item ratings (USIR) in the hybrid user similarity model. The core idea of our improvement is replacing the item ratings in the original model with feature relevance, thereby forming our hybrid user similarity model. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its strengths of rating prediction accuracy compared to the USIR measure. Our work also shows that the incorporation of background knowledge from LOD into a hybrid user similarity model can improve recommendation accuracy.},

In a movie business website, the recommendation system provides users with more options, classify movies under different types to assist in arriving at a decision. Although, with current e-commerce giants focusing on hybrid filtering approach, we have decided to explore the functionality of Content-based recommendation system. This research paper aims to delve deeper into the content-based recommendation system and adding tags to enhance its functionality. The content-based approach is more fit to the movie recommendation as it overcomes the 'cold start' issue faced by the collaborative filtering approach, meaning, even with no ratings for a movie, it can still be recommended. The proposed method is to solve the less 'data categorization' issue in content-based filtering. Collective Intelligence Social Tagging System (CIST) aims at making a significant difference in content-based recommendation system to enrich the item profile and provide more accurate suggestions. The main GIST of CIST is to involve the users to contribute in tagging to build a more robust system in online movie businesses. Tags in the millennial world are the 'go to' words that everyone looks up to in an online world of E-commerce. It's the easiest way of telling a story without actual long sentences. We recommended three main solutions for the concerns of CIST, (a) clustering of tags to avoid synonymous tag confusion and create a metadata for movies under same tags, (b) 5 criteria model to motivate and give the most amount of genuine information for end users to trust and eventually contribute in tagging, and (c) clear way of distinguishing and displaying tags to separate primary tags and secondary tags and give a chance to the users to assess whether the given tags reflect the relevant theme of the film.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are intelligent applications build to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. One of the fundamental recommendation methods in the content-based method that predict ratings by exploiting attributes about the users and items such as users' profile and textual content of items. A current issue faces by recommender systems based on this method is that the systems seem to recommend too similar items to what users have known. Thus, creating over-specialisation issues, in which a self-referential loop is created that leaves user in their own circle of finding and never get expose to new items. In order for these systems to be of significance used, it is important that not only relevant items been recommender, but the items must be also interesting and serendipitous. Having a serendipitous recommendation let users explore new items that they least expect. This has resulted in the issues of serendipity in recommender systems. However, it is difficult to define serendipity because in recommender system, there is no consensus definition for this term. Most of researchers define serendipity based on their research purposes. From the reviews, majority shows that unexpected as the important aspect in defining serendipity. Thus, in this paper, we aim to formally define the concept of serendipity in recommender systems based on the literature work done. We also reviewed few approaches that apply serendipity in the content-based methods in recommendation. Techniques that used Linked Open Data (LOD) approaches seems to be a good candidate to find relevant, unexpected and novel item in a large dataset.},

The scores for each criterion are summed up to rank the importance of the alternatives. Four main criteria are used, e.g. data sensitivity and data ownership representing risks criteria, and data availability and data trustworthy as benefits criteria. For each criterion, there were two sub-criteria identified. Four types of decisions to open data can be made: completely open, maintain suppression, provide limited access, and remain closed. A health patient record dataset is used to illustrate the approach. In further research, we recommend to develop automated approaches that take a dataset as an input and can provide an advice.},

abstract = {Online and mobile dating services often offer recommendation systems to facilitate decision making for their users. These recommendation systems take the form of decision aids that narrow down the size of the dating pool, or delegated agents that select optimal matches on behalf of users. An experiment examined three kinds of factors that influence daters to rely on such recommenders when selecting dates: (a) selection task factors (e.g., number of available daters in the pool and number of information attributes on a profile), (b) daters' personality (e.g., need for cognition), and (c) daters' pre-existing trust in recommender technology. The results reveal that daters were willing to use a decision aid under all circumstances, but that their intent to use a delegated agent was dependent on the size of the choice set and levels of technological trust. This effect was further moderated by personality, such that daters who had a higher need for cognition displayed greater willingness to use a recommender system when facing larger choice sets, compared to those low in need for cognition. This study provides insight into when users are willing to rely on different kinds of recommendation systems for decisions in online dating contexts.},

abstract = {Explaining automatic recommendations is an active area of research since it has shown an important effect on users' acceptance over the items recommended. However, there is a lack of research in explaining content-based recommendations of images based on visual features. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by testing three different interfaces (one baseline and two novel explanation interfaces) for artistic image recommendation. Our experiments with N=121 users confirm that explanations of recommendations in the image domain are useful and increase user satisfaction, perception of explainability, relevance, and diversity. Furthermore, our experiments show that the results are also dependent on the underlying recommendation algorithm used. We tested the interfaces with two algorithms: Deep Neural Networks (DNN), with high accuracy but with diffcult to explain features, and the more explainable method based on Attractiveness Visual Features (AVF). The better the accuracy performance -in our case the DNN method- the stronger the positive effect of the explainable interface. Notably, the explainable features of the AVF method increased the perception of explainability but did not increase the perception of trust, unlike DNN, which improved both dimensions. These results indicate that algorithms in conjunction with interfaces play a significant role in the perception of explainability and trust for image recommendation. We plan to further investigate the relationship between interface explainability and algorithmic performance in recommender systems.},

Electoral datasets containing voting choices linked to voters demographic profile information, can be used to perform fine-grained analysis of citizen opinion. However, it is strongly required to protect voters' privacy. Traditional SDC techniques study methods to met some predefined privacy criteria, assuming a trustworthy owner that knows the values of the confidential attributes. Unfortunately, this assumption cannot be made in our scenario, since its dataset contains secret voting choices, which are unknown until they are properly anonymized and decrypted. We propose a protocol and a system architecture to perform SDC in datasets with encrypted attributes, while minimizing the amount of information an attacker can learn about the secret data. The protocol enables the release of electoral datasets, which allow governments and third parties to gain more insight into citizen opinion, and improve decision making processes and public services.},

abstract = {Open data and data management policies that call for the long-term storage and accessibility of data are becoming more and more commonplace in the research community. With it the need for trustworthy data repositories to store and disseminate data is growing. CoreTrustSeal, a community based and non-profit organisation, offers data repositories a core level certification based on the DSA-WDS Core Trustworthy Data Repositories Requirements catalogue and procedures. This universal catalogue of requirements reflects the core characteristics of trustworthy data repositories. Core certification involves an uncomplicated process whereby data repositories supply evidence that they are sustainable and trustworthy. A repository first conducts an internal self-assessment, which is then reviewed by community peers. Once the self-assessment is found adequate the CoreTrustSeal board certifies the repository with a CoreTrustSeal. The Seal is valid for a period of three years. Being a certified repository has several external and internal benefits. It for instance improves the quality and transparency of internal processes, increases awareness of and compliance with established standards, builds stakeholder confidence, enhances the reputation of the repository, and demonstrates that the repository is following good practices. It is also offering a benchmark for comparison and helps to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a repository. In the future we foresee a larger uptake through different domains, not in the least because within the European Open Science Cloud, the FAIR principles and therefore also the certification of trustworthy digital repositories holding data is becoming increasingly important. Next to that the CoreTrustSeal requirements will most probably become a European Technical standard which can be used in procurement (under review by the European Commission).},

Meanwhile, the quantification method for each attribute is presented by using fuzzy theory. Moreover, this paper improves the method to evaluate the hotel, which respects to the criteria price, rating, and online review by using fuzzy theory. In addition, this proposed approach uses TOPSIS, a classical multi-criteria decision making method, to improve the accuracy further. Finally, a case study is conducted based on Tripadvisor.com to illustrate the validity of the proposed method for hotel recommendation in search engines. The results of the case study indicate that it not only solves the problem of non-personalization, but also improves the accuracy in search engine.},

In this paper, we first present an in-depth study of the inconsistency between users' ratings and their reviews. Then we propose an approach to mine users' “true ratings” which better represent their real feelings, from textual reviews based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and hierarchical attention techniques. One major contribution is that we are about the first, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate this new problem of discovering users' true ratings, and to provide direct solutions to revise ratings that are insincere and inconsistent. Comparative experiments on a real e-commerce dataset have been conducted, which show that the “true ratings” learned by the proposed model is significantly better than the original ones in terms of consistency with the reviews in three sets of crowdsourcing-based evaluations. Furthermore, leveraging different state-of-art recommendation approaches based on the learned “true ratings”, more effective results have been achieved at all times in rating prediction task.},

Collaborative filtering (CF), as one of the most successful recommendation techniques, has been widely studied by various research institutions and industries and has been applied in practice. CF makes recommendations for the current active user using lots of users' historical rating information without analyzing the content of the information resource. However, in recent years, data sparsity and high dimensionality brought by big data have negatively affected the efficiency of the traditional CF-based recommendation approaches. In CF, the context information, such as time information and trust relationships among the friends, is introduced into RS to construct a training model to further improve the recommendation accuracy and user's satisfaction, and therefore, a variety of hybrid CF-based recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this paper, we mainly review and summarize the traditional CF-based approaches and techniques used in RS and study some recent hybrid CF-based recommendation approaches and techniques, including the latest hybrid memory-based and model-based CF recommendation algorithms. Finally, we discuss the potential impact that may improve the RS and future direction. In this paper, we aim at introducing the recent hybrid CF-based recommendation techniques fusing social networks to solve data sparsity and high dimensionality and provide a novel point of view to improve the performance of RS, thereby presenting a useful resource in the state-of-the-art research result for future researchers.},

In social rating networks, a user can label (add) other users as trusted friends to form a social network and this information can be used to significantly improve the performance of the existing recommender systems. This happens by the phenomenon that friends often influence each other in recommending items. We propose a trust based recommender system which uses a variant of genetic algorithms to learn the feature matrix by minimizing the associated loss function and extends TrustSVD which builds on top of a state of the art recommendation system, SVD++. Experimental results on the FilmTrust dataset shows that our approach outperforms TrustSVD in terms of the computational time of learning the model, which can greatly help in providing quick recommendations.},

Easy access to social networks has motivated researchers to incorporating trust information for recommendation. In this paper, aiming at offering fundamental support to the trust-based research for item recommendation, we conduct an in-depth analysis on Epinions, Ciao, and FilmTrust data sets. We find that a user's selection of an item is influenced not only by her trustees but also by her trusters. We leverage this 'dual roles influence' to derive two more accurate matrix factorization (MF)-based ranking models, namely, BPRDR and FSDR, respectively. In more detail, the first BPRDR model performs three pairwise preferences comparisons under the Bayesian personal ranking framework, considering the dual roles influence in its ranking assumptions. The second FSDR is an improved factored similarity model as it incorporates dual roles influence to contribute its ranking scores. Extensive experiments on three data sets show that it is essential to consider the dual roles influence when generating top- K item recommendation.},

Generally, users in OSNs are more willing to choose those services recommended by high trust value entities. In fact, users may suffer from great loss of property once they accept some bad services provided by high trust value entities. However, current schemes do not consider this problem. Hence, we propose a scheme called RHT (recommendation from high trust value entities) to evaluate the trust degree of service recommended by high trust value entities. To be specific, there exist other users who provide their ratings to the service recommended by a high trust value entity, and RHT first selects the trusted ones from those users by computing the similarity between target user and them. Simultaneously, RHT also withstands malicious attacks during the trusted nodes selection. In addition, we also design an adaptive trust computation method to calculate trust value according to the ratings of trusted users. The experimental results show that RHT has higher accuracy in trust evaluation compared with current representative schemes and do effectively resistant four common attacks when choosing trusted nodes.},

The DESIRE approach builds the semantically relevant graphs such as movie-centric and user rating-centric graph with the help of both the Linked Open Data (LOD) and the explicit ratings of the users. By extracting the semantic-path based features from the user rating-centric graph, it executes the ranking algorithm for the top-N movie recommendation. Moreover, the diversity-aware re-ranking tends to maintain the trade-offbetween the diversity and accuracy in the top-N recommendation.},

However, many real-world scenarios, like the traffic one, require the additional feature of representing and reasoning about spatial and temporal knowledge, considering also their vague connotation. This paper tackles this challenge and introduces CARS, a spatio-temporal agent-based recommender system based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Our approach extends the BDI model with spatial and temporal information to represent and reason about fuzzy beliefs and desires dynamics. An experimental evaluation about spatio-temporal reasoning in the traffic domain is carried out using the NetLogo platform, showing the improvements our recommender system introduces to support agents in achieving their goals.},

abstract = {Recently, personalization in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) has been researched extensively. With the spreading of online learning environments (OLE) as MOOCs and LMSs, a large number of learners with different characteristics and backgrounds can follow online courses. To support personalization, recommender systems can be used to provide each learner with learning objects helping him to reach his learning objectives. These recommendations are more specific to compute than usual recommendations (like consumer products). Furthermore, if they are included in a course, they depend not only on the learner's profile but also on the content of the course, because they need to fit with the course format at any point. At the same time, there is a growing number of open educational resources (OER) available to usefully enrich the content of online courses. To facilitate their reuse some of these OERs are described with metadata schemas following Linked Open Data principles (LOD). In this paper, we introduce a MOOC-based OER recommender system (MORS) that can be plugged in an OLE to provide recommendations of OERs to learners based on their profiles, the course profile and a process for calculating recommendations based on OERs metadata. This paper presents our approach that has been implemented in a MOOC platform: Open edX. However the proposed approach could be implemented in any OLE by using the same process to calculate recommendations, as long as the learner and the course profiles can be extracted.},

Common features of reference management software include advanced searching, reference libraries and generation of citations.

The metadata of the research publications and the corresponding PDF files links are extracted using the recommender module and the Application Program Interface from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

abstract = {Recommendation system is becoming one of the most important components in many e-commerce websites and web applications. In the past decades, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most success approach to handle the recommendation task, which leverage users' historical rating data to model users and items preference. As an early approach, the CF algorithm is seriously affected by the data spare problem, which means that most users rate only a few items. This problem distinctly degenerates the performance of CF-based methods. To address this problem, introducing auxiliary information for CF algorithm becomes a necessary trend to improve recommendation accuracy. Therefore, with the development of social media, social recommendation algorithms have been proposed and presented as a potential way to solve this problem. These methods utilizing users' social information to help modeling user preference for recommendation. However, most of them simply make use of the social network information with binary format directly, and thus ignore the fact that the trust degrees between each pair of users are full of variety. In this paper, we propose a new method to measure trust degrees, i.e., how much degrees will users trust in other users, and to integrate these degrees for social recommendation. Advancing previous works, in additional of rating similarity, we focus on the social information to estimate trust degrees and propose the implicit similarity in trust. Specially, we take the indirect social influence of users into account to estimate trust degrees between each pair of users. We obtain the social preferences which contains indirect influence by factorizing the social matrix. Based on these preferences, we propose the implicit similarity in trust for users, which exactly reflect social relations. In addition, based on the intuition that a user plays different preferences with role of truster and trustee, our proposed implicit similarity in trust is consist of two parts: users as truster and as trustee. Moreover, on account of the fact that both rating and social data are very spare, we take both rating and social data into account to enhance the evaluation of trust degrees. In this way, after synthesizing both rating similarity and implicit similarity in trust for each pair of users, we establish an accurate social recommendation model. Furthermore, instead of directly estimating the trust degrees, we propose an adaptive similarity learning model based on both rating similarity and implicit similarity in trust to evaluate trust degrees for recommender system. We conduct several experiments on both Epinions and Ciao datasets, and compared our model with several state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach fully exploits implicit information in rating data and social network, and efficiently improves the performance of social recommendation. Specially, the results are evaluated in terms of two error based metrics (MAE and RMSE) and rank-sensitive metrics (precision, recall and NDCG), and indicate that our approach is robust in both tasks of rating prediction and top-n recommendation tasks. We also demonstrate the results in case of sparse rating data or spare social data, which outperforms previous works. In summary, our approach, fully exploiting implicit information in rating and social data, can efficiently improve recommendation accuracy.},

With the rapid development of social network and e-commerce, building the trust between users and user interest tags to provide a personalized recommendation is becoming an important research issue. In this study, we propose a probability matrix factorization model (STUIPMF) by integrating social trust and user interest. First, we identified implicit trust relationship between users and potential interest label from the perspective of user rating. Then, we used a probability matrix factorization model to conduct matrix decomposition of user ratings information, user trust relationship, and user interest label information, and further determined the user characteristics to ease data sparseness. Finally, we used an experiment based on the Epinions website's dataset to verify our proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can improve the recommendation's accuracy to some extent, ease a cold start and solve new user problems. Meanwhile, the STUIPMF approach, we propose, also has a good scalability.},

abstract = {In the last years, we have witnessed the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) as an integral part of the Internet with billions of interconnected and addressable everyday objects. On one hand, these objects generate a massive volume of data that can be exploited to gain useful insights into our day-to-day needs. On the other hand, context-aware recommender systems (CARSs) are intelligent systems that assist users to make service consumption choices that satisfy their preferences based on their contextual situations. However, one of the key challenges facing the development and deployment of CARSs is the lack of functionality for providing dynamic and reliable context information required by the recommendation decision process. Thus, data obtained from IoT objects and other sources can be exploited to build CARSs that satisfy users' preferences, improve quality of experience, and boost recommendation accuracy. This article describes various components of a conceptual IoT-based framework for context-aware personalized recommendations. The framework addresses the weakness whereby CARSs rely on static and limited contexts from user's mobile phone by providing additional components for reliable and dynamic context information, using IoT context sources. The core of the framework consists of a context classification and reasoning management and a dynamic user profile model, incorporating trust to improve the accuracy of context-aware personalized recommendations. Experimental evaluations show that incorporating context and trust into personalized recommendation process can improve accuracy.},

Twitter has been established as an alternative type of information resource due to its simplicity and its enormous number of users who transmit diverse information in real time. There is evidence that people are becoming increasingly reliant on others' opinion through their social network accounts. Trustable opinion is influential in persuading individuals to purchase products or support policy makers. The domain varies from consumer market to news and politics. Evaluating trust between two people is a delicate subject. In Twitter, neither the social graph nor structured data such as total number of likes or common retweets are sufficient to measure the trustworthiness of a user within a given social group. It is important to consider the actual sentiment associated with the tweets shared between the two parties. Existing approaches only consider relationships among users based on structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to calculate a trust score as a function of time and tweet sentiment.},

Such textile recycling has become a lot easier with clothing retailers now starting to offer recycling checkpoints. Moreover, people today are often challenged by overloaded wardrobes and store many clothing items that they never use. In this paper, we describe an Internet of Things system that creates incentives for the users to recycle their clothes, benefiting the environmental sustainability. We propose a content-based recommendation approach that utilizes semantic web technologies and that leverages a set of context signals obtained from the system's architecture, to recommend clothing items that might be relevant for the user to recycle. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms a baseline which does not utilize semantic web technologies.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online social network services, social networks platforms provide rich information for recommender systems. Based on the assumption that friends share more common interests than non-friends and users tend to accept the item recommendations from friends, more and more recommender systems utilize trust relationships of users to improve the performance of recommendation algorithms. However, most of the existing social-network-based recommendation algorithms ignore the following problems: 1) in different domains, users tend to trust different friends; 2) the degree of influence that a user is affected by their trusted friends is different in different domains since the user has different social status in different domains. In this paper, we first infer domain-specific social trust relation networks based on original users' rating information and social network information, and then compute each user's social status by leveraging PageRank algorithm for each specific domain. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm by integrating users' social status with matrix factorization model. Experimental results on real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms traditional social-network-based recommenda-tion algorithms.},

In this paper, a novel trust-aware recommendation approach for e-commerce is proposed, which unearths the hint from ordinary rating and trust network by users' instant interactions in e-commerce system. More precisely, a rating revamping algorithm is designed to extract semantic ratings from feedback comments, and further construct fine grained rating score for the next process.

@article{Gohari2018,
abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful recommendation techniques. Recently, implicit trust-based recommendation approaches have emerged that incorporate implicit trust information into CF in order to improve recommendation performance. Previous implicit trust models assume that all users have the same perception of ratings. However, although all users employ members of the same rating domain (e.g. ratings on a 1–5 scale), each individual has his own interpretations about a rating domain in order to express his preferences. Thus, it is reasonable that a user's rating vector has some degree of uncertainty, depending upon the rating usage trend of that user. In this paper, we present a new approach for confidence modeling in the context of recommender systems. The idea of this modeling is that confidence in a particular user depends not only on the trust in the opinions of that user but also on the certainty of these opinions. Based on this idea, we propose a new Confidence-Based Recommendation (CBR) approach. This approach employs four different confidence models that derive the users' and items' confidence values from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.},

In an era of information explosion, the key challenges of the recommender system is to obtain valid information from the tremendous amount of information and produce high quality recommendations. However, when facing the large mount of information, the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm usually obtains a high degree of sparseness, which ultimately lead to low accuracy recommendations. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel algorithm named Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Based on Trust Model with Fused Similar Factor, which is based on the trust model and is combined with the user similarity. The novel algorithm takes into account the degree of interest overlap between the two users and results in a superior performance to the recommendation based on Trust Model in criteria of Precision, Recall, Diversity and Coverage. Additionally, the proposed model can effectively improve the efficiency of collaborative filtering algorithm and achieve high performance.},

The collaborative filtering sparse data makes it difficult to: 1) compare elements using memory-based solutions; 2) obtain precise models using model-based solutions; 3) get accurate predictions; and 4) properly cluster elements. We propose the use of a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (BNMF) method to improve the current clustering results in the collaborative filtering area.

Results obtained using several open data sets show: 1) a conclusive clustering quality improvement when BNMF is used, compared with the classical matrix factorization or to the improved KMeans results; 2) a higher predictions accuracy using matrix factorization-based methods than using improved KMeans; and 3) better BNMF execution times compared with those of the classic matrix factorization, and an additional improvement when using the proposed pre-clustering algorithm.},

Currently, such information about a particular user is available from multiple online sources/services, like social media applications, professional/social networking sites, location based service providers or even from simple Web-pages. The nature of this data being truly heterogeneous, high in volume and also highly dynamic over time, the problem of collecting these data artifacts from disparate sources, to enable complete user-profiling can be challenging. In this paper, we present an approach to dynamically build a structured user profile, that emphasizes the temporal nature to capture dynamic user behavior. The user profile is compiled from multiple, heterogeneous data sources which capture dynamic user actions over time, to capture changing preferences accurately. Natural language processing techniques, machine learning and concepts of the semantic Web were used for capturing relevant user data and implement the proposed '3D User Profile'. Our technique also supports the representation of the generated user profiles as structured data so that other personalized recommendation systems and Semantic Web/Linked Open Data applications can consume them for providing intelligent, personalized services.},

abstract = {Social recommendation has been an active research topic over the last decade, based on the assumption that social information from friendship networks is beneficial for improving recommendation accuracy, especially when dealing with cold-start users who lack sufficient past behavior information for accurate recommendation. However, it is nontrivial to use such information, since some of a person's friends may share similar preferences in certain aspects, but others may be totally irrelevant for recommendations. .us one challenge is to explore and exploit the extend to which a user trusts his/her friends when utilizing social information to improve recommendations. On the other hand, most existing social recommendation models are non-interactive in that their algorithmic strategies are based on batch learning methodology, which learns to train the model in an offine manner from a collection of training data which are accumulated from usersfi historical interactions with the recommender systems. In the real world, new users may leave the systems for the reason of being recommended with boring items before enough data is collected for training a good model, which results in an inefficient customer retention. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method for interactive social recommendation, which not only simultaneously explores user preferences and exploits the effectiveness of personalization in an interactive way,but also adaptively learns different weights for different friends. In addition, we also give analyses on the complexity and regret of the proposed model. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the improvement of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Growth of the Internet and web applications has led to vast amount of information over web. Information filtering systems such as Recommenders have become potential tools to deal with such plethora of information, help users select and provide relevant information. Collaborative Filtering is the popular approach to recommendation systems. Collaborative Filtering works on the fact that users with similar behavior will have similar interests in future, and using this notion collaborative filtering recommends items to user. However, the sparseness in data and high dimensionality has become a challenge. To resolve such issues, model based, matrix factorization techniques have well emerged. These techniques have evolved from using simple user-item rating information to auxiliary information such as time and trust. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on such matrix factorization techniques and their usage in recommenders.},

abstract = {Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has attracted many interests recently because of its significant potential for helping users to explore new places and helping location-based service (LBS) providers to carry out precision marketing. Compared with the user-item rating matrix in conventional recommender systems, the user-location check-in matrix in POI recommendation is usually much more sparse, which makes the notorious cold start problem more prominent in POI recommendation. Trust-oriented recommendation is an effective way to deal with this problem but it requires that the recommender has access to user check-in and trust data. In practice, however, these data are usually owned by different businesses who are not willing to share their data with the recommender mainly due to privacy and legal concerns. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to boost data owners willingness to share their data with untrustworthy businesses. More specifically, we utilize partially homomorphic encryption to design two protocols for privacy-preserving trust-oriented POI recommendation. By offline encryption and parallel computing, these protocols can efficiently protect the private data of every party involved in the recommendation. We prove that the proposed protocols are secure against semi-honest adversaries. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that our protocols can achieve privacy-preserving with acceptable computation and communication cost.},

abstract = {Recent development of internet and its applications has become the source for research in service recommendation. Among them, point of interest (POI) recommendation based on user behaviour has enticed a decent attention. Along with quality of recommendations, the utilization of user feedback has grown to be a key part in the POI recommendations. While implementing similarity-based methods in conventional recommender systems, it faces various issues such as trustworthiness, sparsity and cold-start. The commonness and popularity of social network facilitate people to interact with different users and generate massive data such as user relationships, ratings and interactions. Thus, integration of trust relationship of user in location based social network along with their feedback for POI recommendation is the motivation of this work. In this article, we present a POI recommendation method based on trust enhancement in social networks known as social pertinent trust walker (SPTW). Initially, the level of trust between users in social networks is calculated through matrix factorization technique. Then, SPTW with high probability location category algorithm helps to generate POIs as list of recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate proposed algorithm for accuracy. Results reveal the effectiveness of approach and quality of recommendations is better, when compared to existing algorithms.},

It is because some recommenders might have malicious intentions or not the required competence. When a user add other users to his trust list some fake users also get into the list and corrupt the rating prediction for the user. Thus, we have to find out and to decide carefully whom we can trust. Users can't always validate the trustworthiness of everyone providing recommendations. To solve this problem a system that can recommend trust and distrust relations is needed. In the proposed system a user can validate the trustworthiness of a user by submitting a trust evaluation request to the system. The system takes the reviews of the particular user and measure the quality by extracting different features. The system will then calculate trust score of the user and based on the trust score classify the user as either trustworthy or as untrustworthy.

Yet explanations have been shown to improve the transparency of a recommender system by justifying recommendations, and this in turn can enhance the user's trust in the recommendations. Hence, one main challenge in designing a recommender system is mitigating the trade-off between an explainable technique with moderate prediction accuracy and a more accurate technique with no explainable recommendations. In this paper, we focus on factorization models and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes. We propose an explainability constrained MF technique that computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable. Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate and explainable recommendations.},

This is an exciting area for research, and researchers seek to to propose solutions for the best service to users. Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are widely used in recommendation systems, although these are less effective for cold-start users. Recently, some recommender systems have been developed based on social network models, and the results show that social network models have better performance in terms of CF, especially for cold-start users. However, most social network-based recommendations do not consider the user's mood. This is a hidden source of information, and is very useful in improving prediction efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new model called User-Trust Propagation (UTP). The model uses a combination of trust and the mood of users to predict the QoS value and matrix factorisation (MF), which is used to train the model. The experimental results show that the proposed model gives better accuracy than other models, especially for the cold-start problem.},

One of the main challenges of university-industry collaboration is the identification of suitable partners. Due to the information asymmetry problem, it is difficult for companies to identify researchers from universities for collaboration on their R&D projects. Various expert recommendation systems (e.g., question responder recommenders and co-author recommenders) have been proposed, but they fail to characterize companies' needs in identifying suitable researchers. This paper proposes a context-aware researcher recommendation system to encourage university-industry collaboration on industrial R&D projects. The system has two modules: an offline preparation module and an online recommendation module. In the offline preparation module, candidate researchers are identified in advance to improve the efficiency of the context-aware recommendation. In the online recommendation module, contextual information (i.e., R&D projects) is captured from a social network platform, and then, candidate researchers are recommended based on a contextual trust analysis model, which combines the expertise relevance, quality, and trust relations of researchers to profile and evaluate candidate researchers for the R&D project collaboration. An offline experiment and a user study are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system. The results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the baseline methods.},

abstract = {The temporal recommendation system (TRS) is designed for providing users with an accurate prediction based on the history of their behaviour during a precise time. Most TRS approaches use matrix factorization and collaborative filtering, which are prarily based on the distribution of the user preferences. Recently, TRS has gained significant attention because it improves the accuracy of prediction. This is because since the temporal drift in the user preferences is observed, users' preferences within the short term and long term can be utilized to predict the best item to be recommended. Several existing review papers have focused on the general problems of the recommendation system (RS) and similarity measures, and they refer to recent improvements based on three recommendation strategies which are userrating, tagging and trust values. However, there is a lack of recent review papers of TRS with rating score strategy, especially in terms of learning factorization features of temporal terms. This paper fills this gap and highlights the issues and challenges for both general and temporal RS techniques. The prediction approaches based on collaborative filtering technique are reviewed depending on the beaviour of users and items. The challenges and approaches of temporal-based RS are discussed. This review includes the matrix factorization approaches that are integrated with such temporal factors as long-term preferences, short-term preferences, decay, and drift. The outcome of this review prioritizes guidance to focus on matrix factorization, temporal terms and drifting of users' preferences.},

abstract = {Clustering based recommender systems have been demonstrated to be efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets. However, due to the employment of dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering based recommendation approaches generally suffer from relatively low accuracy and coverage. To tackle these problems, some trust clustering based recommendation methods are proposed which cluster the social trust information other than the user-item ratings. Existing trust clustering based recommendation algorithms only consider trust relationships, regardless of the distrust information. In addition, these methods simply perform traditional collaborative filtering method in the detected trust communities, which cannot handle the data sparsity and cold start problems effectively. In order to solve these issues, in this paper, an explicit trust and distrust clustering based collaborative filtering recommendation method is proposed. Firstly, a SVD signs based clustering algorithm is proposed to process the trust and distrust relationship matrix in order to discover the trust communities. Secondly, a sparse rating complement algorithm is proposed to generate dense user rating profiles which alleviates the sparsity and cold start problems to a very large extent. Finally, the prediction of missing ratings can be obtained by combining the newly generated user rating profiles and the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm. Experimental results on real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve both the accuracy and coverage of recommendations as well as in the cold start situation.},

Recent advances have proven that social relations such as trust and distrust relations among users are helpful in improving recommendation accuracy. Traditional social recommendation methods directly utilize unweighted trust and distrust relations into collaborative filtering framework. These methods will lose their power when the trust or distrust relation data is sparse, which significantly hinders the improvement of rating prediction accuracy. To address this problem, we transform the unweighted trust and distrust relations into fine-grained weighted social trust matrix which is denser and encodes the trust and distrust degree for pair of users. The weighted social trust matrix is then combined with the rating matrix in a collective matrix factorization framework to implement rating prediction task. Experimental results based on Extended Epinions dataset show that the proposed collective matrix factorization model with fine-grained weighted social trust matrix can achieve better accuracy than conventional social recommendation algorithms such as SoRec and its extensions.},

abstract = {Cloud service recommendation has become an important technique that helps users decide whether a service satisfies their requirements or not. However, the few existing recommendation systems are not suitable for real world environments and only deal with services hosted in a single cloud, which is simply unrealistic. In addition, a same service may be hosted on more than one cloud and, hence, may have different user ratings that depend on specific conditions of their cloud availability zones. This uncertainty regarding the real quality of the cloud service and users' satisfaction levels raises a question about how to trust the different users' ratings in order to recommend the adequate cloud service. Unlike existing solutions, the goal of this work is to propose a cooperative recommender system that aims to resolve two major issues: recommendation of cloud services in multiple clouds and recommendation under uncertainty of users' ratings. The proposed system will take advantage from a set of powerful techniques and paradigms in order to offer an overlay of cloud recommender entities that cooperate to deliver top-rated services to the user.},

However, the prediction precision of the Slope One algorithm is low. It is important to improve the prediction precision when data is sparse. This paper introduces a trustbased recommend model upon collaborative filtering. Firstly, the fraud users among the raw data set are spotted by employing Bayesian method, and then those fraud ratings are removed; secondly, the degree of trust between users and the degree of trust for ratings itself are calculated; finally, the trust-based recommend model upon collaborative filtering is proposed.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely used technique to guide the users of web applications towards items that might interest them. CF approaches are severely challenged by the characteristics of user-item preference matrices, which are often high dimensional and extremely sparse. Recently, several works have shown that incorporating information from social networks—such as friendship and trust relationships—into traditional CF alleviates the sparsity related issues and yields a better recommendation quality, in most cases. More interestingly, even with comparable performances, social-based CF is more beneficial than traditional CF; the former makes it possible to provide recommendations for cold start users. In this paper, we propose a novel model that leverages information from social networks to improve recommendations. While existing social CF models are based on popular modelling assumptions such as Gaussian or Multinomial, our model builds on the von Mises–Fisher assumption which turns out to be more adequate, than the aforementioned assumptions, for high dimensional sparse data. Setting the estimate of the model parameters under the maximum likelihood approach, we derive a scalable learning algorithm for analyzing data with our model. Empirical results on several real-world datasets provide strong support for the advantages of the proposed model.},

Our learning to rank model focusses on the performance at the top of the list, with the recommended items that endusers will actually see. In our model, we try to push the relevant items of users and their friends at the top of the list, while ranking low those of their foes. Furthermore, we propose a weighting strategy to capture the correlations of users' preferences with friends' trust and foes' distrust degrees in two intermediate trust and distrust-preference user latent spaces, respectively. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset show that the proposed learning to rank model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of sparsity in users' preferences and when a part of trust and distrust relationships is not available.

There may be several terms that refer to the same symptom. Thus, Entity Resolution becomes an essential task to identify a particular disease, for a given symptom. This work aims at suggesting the best alternate treatments to the health care professionals based on the patient's disease. A hybrid recommender system that recommends alternate treatments to the healthcare professionals based on their patient's disease, symptoms, age, and gender is designed and developed. Nowadays, there are new on-going treatments which are much successful know from the clinical trials for a particular disease. The content-based filtering, find the different treatments that are available for user's disease based on their outcome obtained by sentiment analysis. The collaborative filtering uses the similarity measure to find the similarity between the user and the patients by considering their age, gender, location, symptoms, and diseases. The treatments obtained from both these modules are then ranked by assigning a score based on their effectiveness and side effects. Finally, the top-k treatments for the disease are recommended to the health care professionals.},

abstract = {We introduce an axiomatic approach to group recommendations, in line of previous work on the axiomatic treatment of trust-based recommendation systems, ranking systems, and other foundational work on the axiomatic approach to internet mechanisms in social choice settings. In group recommendations we wish to recommend to a group of agents, consisting of both opinionated and undecided members, a joint choice that would be acceptable to them. Such a system has many applications, such as choosing a movie or a restaurant to go to with a group of friends, recommending games for online game players, & other communal activities. Our method utilizes a given social graph to extract information on the undecided, relying on the agents influencing them. We first show that a set of fairly natural desired requirements (a.k.a axioms) leads to an impossibility, rendering mutual satisfaction of them unreachable. However, we also show a modified set of axioms that fully axiomatize a group variant of the random-walk recommendation system, expanding a previous result from the individual recommendation case.},

The two main categories of CF have their own shortcomings. Memory-based CF can't generate accurate results when faced with data sparsity; and model-based CF always loses the information between users or items. To alleviate this problem, we propose an algorithm that integrate user trust into the traditional matrix factorization (MF). Trust network is introduced to utilize all the trusted users to help make prediction. Experiments are performed on Epinions dataset and FilmTrust dataset to compare proposed approach with traditional ones. The reported results indicate that the idea of employing user trust into MF is valid and can improve the recommendation quality.},

Trust links indicate users' social relations and can provide the benefit of reducing data sparsity. However, traditional diffusion-based algorithms only consider rating links when making recommendations. In this paper, the complementarity of users' implicit and explicit trust is exploited, and a novel resource-allocation strategy is proposed, which integrates these two kinds of trust relations on tripartite graphs. Through empirical studies on three benchmark datasets, our proposed method obtains better performance than most of the benchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy, diversity and novelty. According to the experimental results, our method is an effective and reasonable way to integrate additional features into the diffusion-based recommendation approach.},

abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) has been exploited by recommender systems in different ways. One way measures the semantic distance between LOD resources so that nearby resources are considered related and can be recommended, the LDSD method exemplifies this approach. One drawback of the LDSD approach is that it can only compute the semantic distance between two resources that are directly linked or indirectly linked through an intermediate resource. Resources that are located more than two links away are automatically considered unrelated. In this paper, we introduce an approach, called Propagated Linked Data Semantic Distance (PLDSD), that expands the coverage of current semantic distance approaches. We employ an all-pair shortest path algorithm, the well-known Floyd-Warshall algorithm, to expand semantic distance calculations beyond resources that are just one or two links away. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an experiment to identify the relatedness between musical artists in DBpedia, and it demonstrated that, by increasing the reach of semantic distance calculations, PLDSD increases the accuracy of the LOD-based recommendations over our baselines.},

Trust is, therefore, important to make these interactions useful.

Thus, modeling and evaluating trust relationships between agents for a better recommendation, is a major challenge.

This approach is based on a sound mathematical basis, namely the Fuzzy Formal Concepts Analysis and the Theory of Belief Functions.

abstract = {Data sparsity and cold-start problems are prevalent in recommender systems. To address such problems, both the observable explicit social information (e.g., user-user trust connections) and the inferable implicit correlations (e.g., implicit neighbors computed by similarity measurement) have been introduced to complement user-item ratings data for improving the performances of traditional model-based recommendation algorithms such as matrix factorization. Although effective, (1) the utilization of the explicit user-user social relationships suffers from the weakness of unavailability in real systems such as Netflix or the issue of sparse observable content like 0.03% trust density in Epinions, thus there is no or little explicit social information that can be employed to improve baseline model in real applications; (2) the current similarity measurement approaches focus on inferring implicit correlations between a user (item) and their direct neighbors or top-k similar neighbors based on user-item ratings bipartite network, so that they fail to comprehensively unfold the indirect potential relationships among users and items. To solve these issues regarding both explicit/implicit social recommendation algorithms, we design a joint model of matrix factorization and implicit walk integrative learning, i.e., ImWalkMF, which only uses explicit ratings information yet models both direct rating feedbacks and multiple direct/indirect implicit correlations among users and items from a random walk perspective. We further propose a combined strategy for training two independent components in the proposed model based on sampling. The experimental results on two real-world sparse datasets demonstrate that ImWalkMF outperforms the traditional regularized/probabilistic matrix factorization models as well as other competitive baselines that utilize explicit/implicit social information.},

Commonly, neighborhood-based CF methods predict the future ratings based on similar users (user-based) or similar items (itembased) to perform recommendations. However, the reliability of the information provided by these pieces of evidence as well as the final predictions cannot be fully trusted. Incorporating trust in the recommendation process can be argued to be an important challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs). To tackle these issues, we propose new CF approaches under the belief function framework. The final prediction is obtained by fusing evidences from similar items or similar users using Dempster's rule of combination. The prediction process of our evidential approaches is able to provide the users with a global overview of their possible preferences. This would lead to increase their confidence towards the system as well as their satisfaction. In this paper, we mainly highlight the benefits of incorporating uncertainty in CF approaches using the belief function theory. We present the preliminary results and also discuss our ongoing works, as well as the challenges in the future.},

abstract = {Recommender system in social networks has been a solution to the problem of information overload, but easily suffers the challenge of data sparsity and cold start. Meanwhile, since the concept of trust has gained wide concerns, many online social networks begin to introduce trust relationship between users, which motivates us to incorporate trust information to address above problems and improve the quality of recommendation in social networks. Latent Factor Model (LFM) such as SVD++ has been proven effectiveness in social recommendation task. Therefore, this paper proposes a trust networks recommender method based on LFM for rating prediction of recommending items. Our method exploits both explicit and implicit trust information to describe users' relationship and model their social behaviors. Furthermore, we combine LFM with neighborhood model to overcome its inability of interpretation. The experimental results on Epinions can demonstrate that trust information helps alleviate the problem of data sparsity and cold start. Besides, our combination algorithm achieves higher accuracy for prediction and outperforms other trust-based algorithms, including the state-of-the-art method.},

The trust values and the time decay of users' ratings to an item may improve the quality of product rating score in e-commerce platforms, especially when it is thought that nowadays the majority of customers read the reviews before making a purchase. In this paper, we first introduce the concept trust value of users by explaining its mathematical definition and redefine the product rating score based on users' trust relationship. Then we calculate the product rating score based on time decay by making the concept time decay clear. After that we execute both algorithms together in order to show their both effects on the quality of product rating score. Finally, we present experimentally effectiveness of three approaches on a large real dataset.},

Recently different collaborative filtering techniques have been successfully employed to provide precise recommendations. However, sparsity problem is still considered as an important remained challenges. Existing CF based recommendation methods generally focus on positive similarities and trust. In this approach the majority of data containing negative, zero similarity and distrust, are omitted during prediction; which aggravates sparsity problem further. For each target user, we propose to partition the set of the other users into distinct groups according to the state of similarity and trust information. We consider positive zero and negative similarities as well as trust, distrust and zero trust information. In this paper we present a new concept to show that all data in recommender systems are important and can help us to predict new items better. We divide dataset information to nine partition and calculate each partition effectiveness to predict new item separately.},

Most of the existing recommender systems which apply data analysis and behavioral analysis to make personal recommendation have suffered from the problem of low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, a new preference elicitation algorithm is developed by using bipartite graphical correlation and implicit trust. More precisely, to compute the bipartite graphical correlation, an improved single-source shortest path is firstly presented to get the shortest behavior path based on the user-item bipartite graph. While the Markov separation algorithm is employed to separate uncorrelated vertexes and obtain the values of bipartite graphical correlation. Secondly, the implicit trust is used to represent trust relationship between users and items which have no historical behaviors. Independent trust group is applied to represent the closed-loop path on the user-item bipartite graph, and a compute method is developed to get the values of implicit trust based on the trusty values of independent trust group and explicit trust. Finally, a weighted prediction method based on bipartite graphical correlation and implicit trust is employed to compute the final ratings. Our empirical experiments are performed on a sparse data set, the results of which have demonstrated that our method can achieve lower P@R and efficiently improve recommendation quality.},

In this context, explanations act as complementary information that can help users to better comprehend the system's output and to encourage goals such as trust, confidence in decision-making or utility. In this paper we propose a Personalized Social Individual Explanation approach (PSIE). Unlike other expert systems the PSIE proposal novelly includes explanations about the system's group recommendation and explanations about the group's social reality with the goal of inducing a positive reaction that leads to a better perception of the received group recommendations. Among other challenges, we uncover a special need to focus on “tactful” explanations when addressing users' personal relationships within a group and to focus on personalized reassuring explanations that encourage users to accept the presented recommendations. Besides, the resulting intelligent system significatively increases users' intent (likelihood) to follow the recommendations, users' satisfaction and the system's efficiency and trustworthiness.},

However, a majority of existing social recommendation approaches suffer from the following problems: (1) They only employ individual trust among users to optimize prediction solutions in user latent feature space or in user-item rating space; thus, they exhibit low recommendation accuracy. (2) They use decision trees to perform context-based user-item subgrouping; thus, they can only handle categorical contexts. (3) They have difficulty coping with the data sparsity problem. To solve these problems, and accurately and realistically model recommender systems, we propose a social matrix factorization method to optimize the prediction solution in both user latent feature space and user-item rating space using the individual trust among users. To further improve the recommendation performance and alleviate the data sparsity problem, we propose a context-aware enhanced model based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Two real datasets (one sparse dataset and one dense dataset) based experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art social matrix factorization and context-aware recommendation methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

We present the generic components of such workflows to provide a reference model for these stakeholders. The RDA-WDS Data Publishing Workflows group set out to study the current data-publishing workflow landscape across disciplines and institutions. A diverse set of workflows were examined to identify common components and standard practices, including basic self-publishing services, institutional data repositories, long-term projects, curated data repositories, and joint data journal and repository arrangements. The results of this examination have been used to derive a data-publishing reference model comprising generic components. From an assessment of the current data-publishing landscape, we highlight important gaps and challenges to consider, especially when dealing with more complex workflows and their integration into wider community frameworks. It is clear that the data-publishing landscape is varied and dynamic and that there are important gaps and challenges. The different components of a data-publishing system need to work, to the greatest extent possible, in a seamless and integrated way to support the evolution of commonly understood and utilized standards and—eventually—to increased reproducibility. We therefore advocate the implementation of existing standards for repositories and all parts of the data-publishing process, and the development of new standards where necessary. Effective and trustworthy data publishing should be embedded in documented workflows. As more research communities seek to publish the data associated with their research, they can build on one or more of the components identified in this reference model.},

The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

However, building a trust model with a recommender system in dynamic and distributed networks is a challenging problem due to the risk of dishonest recommendations. Dealing with dishonest recommendations can result in the additional problem of data sparsity, which is related to the availability of information in the early rounds of the network time or when nodes are inactive in providing recommendations. This paper investigates the problems of data sparsity and cold start of recommender systems in existing trust models. It proposes a recommender system with clustering technique to dynamically seek similar recommendations based on a certain timeframe. Similarity between different nodes is evaluated based on important attributes includes use of interactions, compatibility of information and closeness between the mobile nodes. The recommender system is empirically tested and empirical analysis demonstrates robustness in alleviating the problems of data sparsity and cold start of recommender systems in a dynamic MANET environment.},

abstract = {Short-head and long-tail distributed data are widely observed in the real world. The same is true of recommender systems (RSs), where a small number of popular items dominate the choices and feedback data while the rest only account for a small amount of feedback. As a result, most RS methods tend to learn user preferences from popular items since they account for most data. However, recent research in e-commerce and marketing has shown that future businesses will obtain greater profit from long-tail selling. Yet, although the number of long-tail items and users is much larger than that of short-head items and users, in reality, the amount of data associated with long-tail items and users is much less. As a result, user preferences tend to be popularity-biased. Furthermore, insufficient data makes long-tail items and users more vulnerable to shilling attack. To improve the quality of recommendations for items and users in the tail of distribution, we propose a coupled regularization approach that consists of two latent factor models: C-HMF, for enhancing credibility, and S-HMF, for emphasizing specialty on user choices. Specifically, the estimates learned from C-HMF and S-HMF recurrently serve as the empirical priors to regularize one another. Such coupled regularization leads to the comprehensive effects of final estimates, which produce more qualitative predictions for both tail users and tail items. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct empirical evaluations on large real-world datasets with various metrics. The results prove that our approach significantly outperforms the compared methods.},

First, by discriminating between different users, we calculate the significance of each user to make recommendations. Then, the trusted neighbors of the active user are identified and aggregated. Hence, a new rating profile can be established to represent the preferences of the active user. In the next step, similar users probed based on the new rating profile. Finally, recommendations are generated in the same way as the conventional CF with the difference that if a similar neighbor had not rated the target item, we will predict the value of the target item for this similar neighbor by using the ratings of her directly trusted neighbors and applying MoleTrust algorithm, to combine more similar users to generate a prediction for this target item. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other counterparts both in terms of accuracy and in terms of coverage.},

abstract = {Trust networks have been widely used to mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start problems of collaborative filtering. Recently, some approaches have been proposed which exploit explicit signed trust relationships, i.e., trust and distrust relationships. These approaches ignore the fact that users despite trusting/distrusting each other in a trust network may have different preferences in real-life. Most of these approaches also handle the notion of the transitivity of distrust as well as trust. However, other existing work observed that trust is transitive while distrust is intransitive. Moreover, explicit signed trust relationships are fairly sparse and may not contribute to infer true preferences of users. In this paper, we propose to create implicit signed trust relationships and exploit them along with explicit signed trust relationship to solve sparsity problem of trust relationships. We also confirm the similarity (resp. dissimilarity) of implicit and explicit trust ( resp. distrust) relationships by using the similarity score between users so that users' true preferences can be inferred. In addition to these strategies, we also propose a matrix factorization model that simultaneously exploits implicit and explicit signed trust relationships along with rating information and also handles transitivity of trust and intransitivity of distrust. Extensive experiments on Epinions dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy.},

However, most existing trust-based approaches are designed for the recommendation task of rating prediction. Only few trust-aware methods have attempted to recommend users an ordered list of interesting items, i.e., item recommendation. In this article, we propose three factored similarity models with the incorporation of social trust for item recommendation based on implicit user feedback. Specifically, we introduce a matrix factorization technique to recover user preferences between rated items and unrated ones in the light of both user-user and item-item similarities. In addition, we claim that social trust relationships also have an important impact on a user's preference for a specific item. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior ranking performance to other counterparts.},

We identify the most promising path types in a structured information network, i.e., Linked Open Data (LOD), based on variable importance scores. In contrast to previous work, we focus on which information is most important and remove path types that appear unimportant. The methodology is tested on the MovieLens 1M dataset, semantically enhanced with data from the LOD cloud. The results are threefold. First, we find that the LOD cloud is useful especially for small user profiles. Secondly, we find that the LOD cloud is useful for large user profiles only when the most popular items are not considered. Lastly, we find that selecting the most relevant data from the LOD cloud improves performance compared to using all extracted LOD data.},

Trust metrics help leverage preferences of similar users and have led to improved predictive accuracy which is why they have become an important consideration in the design of RSs. We argue that there are additional aspects of trust as a human notion, that can be integrated with collaborative filtering techniques to suggest to users items that they might like. In this paper, we present an approach for the top-N recommendation task that computes prediction scores for items as a user specific combination of global and local trust models to capture differences in preferences.

To this end, in this article we study the impact of the exogenous knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation framework. Specifically, we propose a methodology to automatically feed a graph-based RS with features gathered from the LOD cloud and we analyze the impact of several widespread feature selection techniques in such recommendation settings. The experimental evaluation, performed on three state-of-the-art datasets, provided several outcomes: first, information extracted from the LOD cloud can significantly improve the performance of a graph-based RS. Next, experiments showed a clear correlation between the choice of the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize specific evaluation metrics, as accuracy or diversity of the recommendations. Moreover, our graph-based algorithm fed with LOD-based features was able to overcome several baselines, as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.},

Its recommendation accuracy highly relies on the selection of appropriate neighbors for the target user/item based on a user-item matrix. However, existing neighbor selection schemes have inevitable inadequacies, especially when handling a very sparse user-item matrix caused by the increasing amount of users and items in recommender systems. To improve the recommendation accuracy, we propose a novel two-layer neighbor selection scheme that improves the quality of neighbor selections by selecting the most influential and trustworthy neighbors. In particular, the proposed scheme consists of two modules: (1) an availability evaluation module and (2) a trust evaluation module, which evaluate users' influence and trustworthiness in providing recommendations. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated through experiments on a real user dataset. Compared to three existing neighbor selection schemes, the proposed scheme achieves higher recommendation accuracy across datasets with different degrees of sparseness.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation technique that uses preferences of users in a community to make personal recommendations for other users. Despite its popularity and success, CF suffers from the data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting trust information to improve the performance of CF. In general, trust has a number of distinct properties such as asymmetry, transitivity, dynamicity and context-dependency. However, conventional trust-based CF systems do not address trust computation by considering all the properties of trust. Particularly, the context-dependency property has received less attention in the existing approaches. The consideration of all these properties leads to more accurate recommendations since the quality of the inferred is improved. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based approach, called Semantic-enhanced Trust based Ant Recommender System (STARS), which satisfies all the properties mentioned above. Using ant colony optimization, the proposed system performs a depth- first search for the optimal trust paths in the trust network and selects the best neighbors of an active user to provide better recommendations. To consider the context-dependency property, trust inference in STARS depends on the semantic descriptions of items. Incorporation of both global and local trust in CF-based recommender systems in addition to the trust computation based on the semantic features of items allows STARS to alleviate the data sparsity, cold-start and “multiple-interests and multiple-content” problems of CF. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that STARS outperforms its counterparts in terms of prediction accuracy and recommendation quality and can overcome the above problems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) have become important tools for solving the problem of information overload. With the advent and popularity of online social networks, some studies on network-based recommendation have emerged, raising the concern of many researchers. Trust is one kind of important information available in social networks and is often used for performance improvement in social-network-based RSs. However, most trust-aware RSs ignore the fact that people trust different subsets of friends pertaining to different domains, such as music and movies, because people behave differently in diverse domains according to different interests. This paper proposes a novel recommendation method called TruCom. In a multicategory item recommendation domain, TruCom first generates a domain-specific trust network pertaining to each domain and then builds a unified objective function for improving recommendation accuracy by incorporating the hybrid information of direct and indirect trust into a matrix factorization recommendation model. Through relevant benchmark experiments on two real-world data sets, we show that TruCom achieves better performance than other existing recommendation methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of TruCom.},

abstract = {Recommender system is a specific type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role in a wide range of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete cold start (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for cold start items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of cold start items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from cold start to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for cold start item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of cold start item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote cold start items.},

However, spontaneous changes in user preferences are ubiquitous in many domains like media consumption and key factors that drive changes in preferences are not directly observable. These latent sources of preference change pose new challenges. When systems do not track and adapt to users' tastes, users lose confidence and trust, increasing the risk of user churn. We meet these challenges by developing a model of novelty preferences that learns and tracks latent user tastes. We combine three innovations: A new measure of item similarity based on patterns of consumption co-occurrence; model for spontaneous changes in preferences; and a learning agent that tracks each user's dynamic preferences and learns individualized policies for variety. The resulting framework adaptively provides users with novelty tailored to their preferences for change per se.},

Positive and negative approaches towards the shared posts or links can be determined by likes and dislikes and also consider the opinions towards comments.

On line virtual groups are becoming progressively prominent due to the growth of community and social networking sites. The proposed framework is helpful for handling trust peoples in social networks, which is based on a prominence mechanism that captures the connections between the network members(trust user, distrust user), analyzes the semantics of these connections, and provides personalized user recommendations.},

In this paper, we focus on the recommendation system to integrate the preference information and trust relations among users, following the trust-based recommendation model (TbRM) [1] which considers both the user's reputation and his/her nearest neighbors in the social network. Our main contribution is to present a fast algorithm to solve TbRM model with the aid of graph vertex programming (GVP) in parallel. The idea is to represent the preference and trust information as a graph with both user and item vertices, and its edges contain the preference and trust information. In this case, the recommendation problem becomes a graph analysis procedure which iteratively updates the vertices' states in parallel with the aid of predefined vertex state function and edge information. A series of experiments on four real-world recommendation datasets (Ciao, Epinions, Douban and Flixster) have shown that the graph parallel operations obviously speed up the recommendation procedure, e.g., GVP performs 1.1-2.3× faster than the existing popular distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm with different number of cores.},

To al- low consumers to select an optimal product, it is necessary to understand the human purchasing model and discover an interface design that can effectively present information. It has been predicted that pages that include negative eWOM facilitate trust toward the system, although cognitive resources are required to process the information. The results of a controlled experiment show that participants who encountered negative eWOM and have less cognitive load could developed higher trust toward the product and were motivated to purchase it. This study implies that cognitive factors such as access to negative eWOM are important for developing trust and motivating product buying behavior. It contributes to determining when negative eWOM can be effective and provides new knowledge about developing consumer buying models on the web.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are playing an important role in improving user satisfaction as they can recommend items which might be highly interested to users. In recent years, it has been observed that social relations including factors such as trust and distrust among users are very useful in improving recommendation accuracy. However, traditional recommendation methods like Collaborative Filtering (CF) usually neglect social relations and even for those methods which considered social relations often fail to uncover different types of positive and negative social relations, which hinders the improvement of recommendation accuracy. To solve such a problem, in this paper, we first divide user trust relations into four fine-grained types, including strong trust, weak trust, strong distrust and weak distrust, which help to thoroughly exploit the trust and distrust relations among users. Afterwards, we propose a trust prediction framework based on a SVD algorithm to obtain weighted social relations. Finally, we employ two examples on rating prediction to demonstrate how to use fine-grained user trust relations. Experimental results based on Extended Epinions dataset show that our proposed approach based on fine-grained user trust relations can achieve better accuracy than other conventional approaches.},

Users' interests might change over time, and thus accurate modelling of dynamic users' tastes is a challenging issue in designing efficient recommendation systems.

Be that as it may, a large segment of existing strategies concentrate on the recommendation situations where users can give express feedback to items. Be that as it may, much of the time, the feedback isn't express however understood. Additionally, the majority of trust aware techniques expect the trust relationships among users are single and homogeneous, while trust as a social idea is naturally multi-faceted and heterogeneous. Just abusing the crude estimations of trust relations can't get agreeable outcomes. In light of the above perceptions, we propose to take in a trust aware personalized ranking method with multi-faceted trust relations for certain input. Recommender systems have been generally used to furnish users with top notch customized recommendations from an extensive volume of decisions. Hearty and exact recommendations are imperative in internet business operations (e.g., exploring item offerings, personalization, enhancing consumer loyalty), and in promoting. The previous issue alludes to the way that users as a rule rate just a little bit of items while the last shows that new users just give a couple of ratings. The two issues extremely corrupt the effectiveness of a recommender system in displaying client inclinations and therefore the exactness of anticipating a user's appraising for an ambiguous item.},

abstract = {With the rapid expansion of cloud services and the development of online trading and social network sites, various recommender systems are becoming prevalent and have been accepted well by the clients. It is necessary to provide accurate and reliable recommendations for users so that they trust the system and accept the recommendations. The more utility data is available to the system, the more accurate recommendations can be generated. There exist such systems where the data are distributed into multiple organizations and to generate satisfactory recommendations, these data need to be integrated. However, data related to user preferences are usually confidential and it is unlikely that any organization will agree to share its own data with other entities. To provide advanced facilities for securing privacy of data in distributed recommender systems, we propose a new system called Privacy-preserving Weighted Slope One Predictor for Vertically Partitioned Data (PWSOP-VPD). It generates recommendations in a privacy-preserving manner by integrating users' data distributed among several different organizations. In this protocol, private records are encrypted by means of homomorphic encryption and secure recommendations are provided based on the encrypted data. Our paper examines the PWSOP-VPD protocol for a real world dataset and shows that the proposed method is secure and outperforms previous solutions, which addressed more restricted special cases of this general scenario.},

So, we first propose an inference step with multiple random walks to predict the implicit-missing trust relationships that users might have in recommender systems, while considering users' explicit trust and distrust relationships during the inference. We introduce a regularization method and design an objective function with a social regularization term to weigh the influence of friends' trust and foes' distrust degrees on users' preferences. We formulate the objective function of our regularization method as a minimization problem with respect to the users' and items' latent features and then we solve our recommendation problem via gradient descent. Our experiments confirm that our approach preserves relatively high recommendation accuracy in the presence of sparsity in both the users' preferences and social relationships, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The use of Linked Open Data (LOD) has been explored in recommender systems in different ways, primarily through its graphical representation. The graph structure of LOD is utilized to measure inter-resource relatedness via their semantic distance in the graph. The intuition behind this approach is that the more connected resources are to each other, the more related they are. The drawback of this approach is that it treats all inter-resource connections identically rather than prioritizing links that may be more important in semantic relatedness calculations. In this paper, we show that different properties of inter-resource links hold different values for relatedness calculations between resources, and we exploit this observation to introduce improved resource semantic relatedness measures, Weighted Linked Data Semantic Distance (WLDSD) and Weighted Resource Similarity (WResim), which are more accurate than the current state of the art approaches. Exploiting these proposed weighted approaches, we also present two different ways to calculate links weights: Resource-Specific Link Awareness Weights (RSLAW) and Information Theoretic Weights (ITW). To validate the effectiveness of our approaches, we conducted an experiment to identify the relatedness between musical artists in DBpedia, and it demonstrated that approaches that prioritize link properties resulted in more accurate recommendation results.},

abstract = {We introduce Poisson Matrix Factorization with Content and Social trust information (PoissonMF-CS), a latent variable probabilistic model for recommender systems with the objective of jointly modeling social trust, item content and user's preference using Poisson matrix factorization framework. This probabilistic model is equivalent to collectively factorizing a non-negative user–item interaction matrix and a non-negative item–content matrix. The user–item matrix consists of sparse implicit (or explicit) interactions counts between user and item, and the item–content matrix consists of words or tags counts per item. The model imposes additional constraints given by the social ties between users, and the homophily effect on social networks – the tendency of people with similar preferences to be socially connected. Using this model we can account for and fine-tune the weight of content-based and social-based factors in the user preference. We develop approximate variational inference algorithm and perform experiments comparing PoissonMF-CS with competing models. The experimental evaluation indicates that PoissonMF-CS achieves superior predictive performance on held-out data for the top-M recommendations task. Also, we observe that PoissonMF-CS generates compact latent representations when compared with alternative models while maintaining superior predictive performance.

A kernel, which consists of hub nodes of the trust network, is involved in trust propagations. The kernel can be obtained from node degree or node betweenness, take these hub nodes as active users and then finds the recommenders via trust propagations from the kernel, most of the nodes in the network will be covered. Comparing the results of these two methods, the coverage rate of these hub nodes which is obtained from the node degree is almost less than that obtained from the node betweenness. To get better coverage rate, we take both degree and betweenness into consideration. The results show that the combination can get better coverage rate only compared with the node degree. However, the combination has better convergence effect compared with the node betweenness.},

Afterwards, we have used this method in a semantic tourism recommender system as a smart e-tourism tool able to recommend items based on the users' preferences and their trusted friends' preferences. We have also applied our tourism recommender system for the case of medical tourism in Tunisia to help users interested in traveling to Tunisia for medical purposes.

abstract = {A major challenge of the contemporary information age is the overwhelming and increasing data amount, especially when looking for specific information. Searching for relevant information is no longer manually possible, but has to rely on automatic methods, specifically, similarity search. From a formal perspective, similarity search can be seen as the problem of finding entities, which are considered to be similar to a query with respect to certain describing features. The question which features or which weighted combination of features to use for a given query creates a need for semi-automatic methods to address the needs of diverse users. Furthermore, the quality of the results of a similarity search is more than effectiveness, measured by precision and recall. The user ideally needs to trust the results and understand how they were computed. We propose to apply Visual Analytics methodologies, for synergistic cooperation of user and algorithms, to integrate three key dimensions of similarity search: users, tasks, and data for effective search. However, there exists a gap in knowledge how user, task as well as the available data influence each other and the similarity search. In this concept paper, we envision how Visual Analytics can be used to tackle current challenges of similarity search.},

abstract = {Social recommender systems exploit users' social relationships to improve recommendation accuracy. Intuitively, a user tends to trust different people regarding with different scenarios. Therefore, one main challenge of social recommendation is to exploit the most appropriate dependencies between users for a given recommendation task. Previous social recommendation methods are usually developed based on pre-defined user dependencies. Thus, they may not be optimal for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation method, named probabilistic relational matrix factorization (PRMF), which can automatically learn the dependencies between users to improve recommendation accuracy. In PRMF, users' latent features are assumed to follow a matrix variate normal (MVN) distribution. Both positive and negative user dependencies can be modeled by the row precision matrix of the MVN distribution. Moreover, we also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem of PRMF. Extensive experiments on four real datasets have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PRMF model.},

abstract = {With the popularity of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the associated rise in freely accessible knowledge that can be accessed via LOD, exploiting LOD for recommender systems has been widely studied based on various approaches such as graph-based or using different machine learning models with LOD-enabled features. Many of the previous approaches require construction of an additional graph to run graph-based algorithms or to extract path-based features by combining user-item interactions (e.g., likes, dislikes) and background knowledge from LOD. In this paper, we investigate Factorization Machines (FMs) based on particularly lightweight LOD-enabled features which can be directly obtained via a public SPARQL Endpoint without any additional effort to construct a graph. Firstly, we aim to study whether using FM with these lightweight LOD-enabled features can provide competitive performance compared to a learning-to-rank approach leveraging LOD as well as other well-established approaches such as kNN-item and BPRMF. Secondly, we are interested in finding out to what extent each set of LOD-enabled features contributes to the recommendation performance. Experimental evaluation on a standard dataset shows that our proposed approach using FM with lightweight LOD-enabled features provides the best performance compared to other approaches in terms of five evaluation metrics. In addition, the study of the recommendation performance based on different sets of LOD-enabled features indicate that property-object lists and PageRank scores of items are useful for improving the performance, and can provide the best performance through using them together for FM. We observe that subject-property lists of items does not contribute to the recommendation performance but rather decreases the performance.},

The proposed ridge alternating least squares imputation uses class information to create substituted values, which approximate the characteristics of their corresponding classes, for missing entries. In the training phase, the incomplete data with label information are divided into different classes based on their labels, such that basis matrices become class-dependent. Subsequently, iterative projection pursuit is proposed to perform imputation for testing data by computing the linear combination of these class-dependent basis matrices and their corresponding reconstruction weights. The class-dependent basis matrix with the minimum loss during reconstruction is regarded as the correct imputation for a testing sample, of which the substituted values are derived from the matrix factors of its class. Experiments on open data sets showed that the proposed method successfully decreased the imputation error by 40.52% on average, better than typical unsupervised collaborative filtering, while maintaining classification accuracy.},

In addition, trust is often used to rank nodes in a network and the higher the rank the more preferred that node will be, therefore each node aims at getting a better position. Since a proper trade-off between the desired position and the related cost should be achieved, in this paper we analyse the rank-vs-cost function in trust networks, considering different topologies and different number of nodes. Results show that if we look for the first position (best rank), the effort is independent on network size for all topologies but scale-free, where costs increases strongly. Moreover, if we accept to achieve a good position, i.e., within the first 5% or 10% of nodes, all networks exhibit similar behaviour for any sizes.},

It greatly improves the conventional collaborative filtering by providing reliable recommendations when dealing with the data sparseness problem. One basic research issue of TARS is to improve the recommending efficiency, in which the key point is to find sufficient number of recommenders efficiently for active users. Existing works searched recommenders via a skeleton, which consists of a number of hub nodes. The hub nodes are those who have superior degrees based on the scale-freeness of the trust network. However, existing works did not consider the skeleton maintenance cost and the coverage overlap between nodes of the skeleton. They also failed to suggest the proper size of the skeleton. This paper proposes an optimized TARS model to solve the problems of existing works. By using the genetic algorithm, our model chooses the most suitable nodes for the skeleton of recommender searching. It can achieve the maximum prediction coverage with the minimum skeleton maintenance cost. Simulation results show that compared with existing works, our model can reduce more than 90% of the skeleton maintenance cost with reasonable prediction coverage.},

abstract = {Android operating system uses a security mechanism based on permissions to restrict mobile apps to access sensitive device resources. However, because of such disadvantages as coarse-granularity of permission management and vague permission description, the current permission-based security mechanism of Android is not sufficiently effective in practice. In addition, only a small number of users realize the importance of permission settings and mostly they cannot make a proper decision on permission settings due to lack of runtime information and professional knowledge. In this paper, we propose PerRec, a permission configuration recommender system based on trust management, which assists the mobile users to set permissions in order to enhance user privacy and device security. It is designed based on our pre-developed reputation system named TruBeRepec [1] to get the trust and reputation values of an app and further offer recommendations on how to set permissions. Based on system implementation, we evaluate the accuracy and safety of PerRec by comparing PerRec's recommendations with the Android system default permission settings. The result shows that PerRec can provide effective permission recommendations to prevent potential security threats. We further conduct a small-scale user study to demonstrate its user acceptance.},

abstract = {Recommendation plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives. Recommender systems automatically suggest items to users that might be interesting for them. Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be extracted from users' ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social relation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both: trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the state-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction.},

By now, research has resulted in highly sophisticated recommender algorithms whose further optimization often yields only marginal improvements. This paper goes beyond the commonly dominating focus on optimizing algorithms and instead follows the idea of enhancing recommender systems with reputation data. Since the concept of reputationenhanced recommender systems has attracted considerable attention in recent years, the main aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the approaches proposed so far. To this end, existing work are identified by means of a systematic literature review and classified according to carefully considered dimensions.

abstract = {The aspect of control in recommender systems has already been extensively researched in the past. Quite a number of studies performed by various researchers reported that an increase in control had a positive effect for example on user satisfaction with a system, or recommendation accuracy. Recent studies investigated whether this positive effect of control applies to all users, or finer distinctions have to be made between different user groups, which in turn require different levels of control. Those studies identified several characteristics, along which users could be divided into groups: expertise in recommender systems, domain knowledge, trusting propensity, persistence. They reported different needs of control for different user groups. However, the effect of those characteristics has not been systematically examined with regard to all three recommendation phases introduced earlier by Pu and Zhang, namely initial preference elicitation, preference refinement, result display. This paper suggests, that for different levels of expertise and trust, different levels of control are necessary during preference elicitation, whereas persistence does not play a prevalent role in this phase. Further assumptions are made for preference refinement and result display. In addition to the three phases, context, type of information required and visualization of control methods are identified as factors influencing the request of users for control.},

abstract = {With the continuous growth of the Internet and the progress of electronic commerce the issues of product recommendation and privacy protection are becoming increasingly important. Recommender Systems aim to solve the information overload problem by providing accurate recommendations of items to users. Collaborative filtering is considered the most widely used recommendation method for providing recommendations of items or users to other users in online environments. Additionally, collaborative filtering methods can be used with a trust network, thus delivering to the user recommendations from both a database of ratings and from users who the person who made the request knows and trusts. On the other hand, the users are having privacy concerns and are not willing to submit the required information (e.g., ratings for products), thus making the recommender system unusable. In this paper, we propose (a) an approach to product recommendation that is based on collaborative filtering and uses a combination of a ratings network with a trust network of the user to provide recommendations and (b) “neighbourhood privacy” that employs a modified privacy-aware role-based access control model that can be applied to databases that utilize recommender systems. Our proposed approach (1) protects user privacy with a small decrease in the accuracy of the recommendations and (2) uses information from the trust network to increase the accuracy of the recommendations, while, (3) providing privacy-preserving recommendations, as accurate as the recommendations provided without the privacy-preserving approach or the method that increased the accuracy applied.},

abstract = {In this article we investigate how the knowledge available in the Linked Open Data cloud (LOD) can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of a semantics-aware graph-based recommendation framework based on Personalized PageRank (PPR). In our approach we extended the classic bipartite data model, in which only user-item connections are modeled, by injecting the exogenous knowledge about the items which is available in the LOD cloud. Our approach works in two steps: first, all the available items are automatically mapped to a DBpedia node; next, the resources gathered from DBpedia that describe the item are connected to the item nodes, thus enriching the original representation and giving rise to a tripartite data model. Such a data model can be exploited to provide users with recommendations by running PPR against the resulting representation and by suggesting the items with the highest PageRank score. In the experimental evaluation we showed that our semantics-aware recommendation framework exploiting DBpedia and PPR can overcome the performance of several state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, a proper tuning of PPR parameters, obtained by better distributing the weights among the nodes modeled in the graph, further improved the overall accuracy of the framework and confirmed the effectiveness of our strategy.},

To the best of our knowledge, none of the prior works studied if users' tendency to seek information has an effect on recommender systems' performance.

As an additional dimension of information to past rating history, trust has been shown to be helpful for improving the accuracy of recommendations. Studies on the relationship between trust and rating behaviors may provide insights into the formation of trust in the context of online community, and lead to possible indicators for the effective use of trust in recommendations. In this paper, we study people's trust and rating behavior with the Epinions dataset. Epinions.com is a popular product review website allowing users to rate various categories of products, and establish a list of trustworthy users. We perform correlation analysis of activeness and trustworthiness defined by the number of ratings and the number of trustors to derive findings that can help the design of new decision support mechanisms in trust-based recommender systems. We then propose a trustee-influence based trust model where a trustee's activeness or trustworthiness is used to determine trust relationships. This trust model is incorporated into a memory-based and matrix factorization recommender systems to support online purchasing decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust model for recommendation.},

abstract = {In a vast data collection and processing applications of machine to machine communications, identifying malicious information and nodes is important, if the collected information is to be utilized in any decision making algorithm. In this process, nodes can learn behaviors of their peers in the form of recommendation from other nodes. These recommendations can be altered due to various motives such as badmouthing honest nodes or ballot stuffing malicious nodes. A receiving node can identify an incorrect recommendation by computing similarity between its own opinion and received recommendations. However, if the ratio of false recommendations is low, the similarity score will be insufficient to detect malicious misbehavior. Therefore in this paper, an entropy-based recommendation trust model is proposed. In this model, a receiving node computes the conditional entropy using consistency and similarity of received recommendations with respect to its own opinions. The computed entropy indicates the trustworthiness of the sender. The proposed model clearly distinguishes malicious nodes from honest nodes by iteratively updating trust values with each message. The performance of the model is validated by a high true positive rate and a false positive rate of zero.},

Along with this, the proposed system matches profiles of the users under consideration. The profile matching is used in reputation ratings calculated for suggestions of friends. For computing the reputation of each member, the properties of trust such as transitivity, personalization, and context are adopted by the proposed system. In social networks, trust cannot be perfectly transitive and also it decreases along the transition path, but people can communicate the trust.

Although effective, the utilization of the explicit user-user relationships extracted directly from such social information has three main limitations. First, it is difficult to obtain explicit and reliable social links. Only a small portion of users indicate explicitly their trusted friends in recommender systems. Second, the "cold-start" users are "cold" not only on rating but also on socializing. There is no significant amount of explicit social information that can be useful for "cold-start" users. Third, an active user can be socially connected with others who have different taste/preference. Direct usage of explicit social links may mislead recommendation. To address these issues, we propose to extract implicit and reliable social information from user feedbacks and identify top-k semantic friends for each user. We incorporate the top-k semantic friends information into MF and BPR frameworks to solve the problems of ratings prediction and items ranking, respectively. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed approaches achieve better results than the state-of-the-art MF with explicit social links (with 3.0% improvement on RMSE), and social BPR (with 9.1% improvement on AUC).},

Surprisingly, seldom little has been done to analyze the correlation between trust and rating similarity. In this paper, we examine the relationship between rating similarity-based implicit trust and trust that is explicitly expressed by users. We develop a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of trust between users based on rating similarity between them. We use the large, publicly available Epinion dataset to derive the best fitting model parameters and validate the model. An empirical analysis of the relationship between rating similarity and explicit trust reveals a positive albeit very weak correlation between them. Further, we conduct experiments on implicit similarity trust prediction for varying values of similarity threshold and co-rated item count threshold. In general, results indicate low values of precision, recall, and coverage over the entire range of similarity threshold. The best precision that was obtained was 23.8 %, but with a coverage of only 0.6 % users. Best coverage value was 19.7 % but with precision of 3.2 % only. In fact, better precision can be obtained by predicting trust only on the basis of number of co-rated items without considering rating similarity between users. We therefore conclude that implicit trust based on rating similarity is not a reliable representation of trust between users.},

The above-mentioned challenges necessitate us to introduce a comprehensive framework that is able to leverage the additional source of information for boosting the accuracy of the existing systems. In this paper, we have proposed a modified Joint Matrix Factorization approach for incorporating semantic information related to items and tag-based information with an implicit user preference for boosting the accuracy of the overall system. The model adheres to the phenomena of time-variant Recommender System; thus, it also utilizes the time-related information of items. Experimental results show that our method gets more accurate recommendation results with faster converging speed than other existing Matrix Factorization-based approaches.},

Prior research has demonstrated that a trade-off between relevance and profit exists, and that recommendations' manipulations and biases may hurt the credibility of recommender systems, and thus reduces customer trust. While many of the proposed designs suggest simple heuristics to bias recommendations toward higher-margin items, very little is known about consumers' reactions (in terms of purchasing behavior and trust) to recommender algorithms that balance recommendations' relevance and profitability or the drivers of this behavior. We aim to fill this gap. Data from an online randomized field experiment showed that balancing recommendations' accuracy and profit has a positive effect on consumers' purchasing behavior and does not affect their trust. We also found that the profit made during our experiment was due to a balance of several variables.},

Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a differentiating point of services to attract customers. Since the QoS of services varies widely among users due to the unpredicted network, physical location and other objective factors, many Collaborative Filtering based approaches are recently proposed to predict the unknown QoS by employing the historical user-contributed QoS data. However, most existing approaches ignore the data credibility problem and are thus vulnerable to the unreliable QoS data contributed by dishonest users. To address this problem, we propose a trust-aware approach TAP for reliable personalized QoS prediction. Firstly, we cluster the users and calculate the reputation of users based on the clustering information by a beta reputation system. Secondly, a set of trustworthy similar users is identified according to the calculated user reputation and similarity. Finally, we identify a set of similar services by clustering the services and make prediction for active users by combining the QoS data of the trustworthy similar users and similar services. Comprehensive real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Since trust and distrust are a gradual phenomenon, they can be stated more naturally by fuzzy logic. Finding the most appropriate fuzzy sets which cover the domains of trust and distrust is not an easy task. Existing research on fuzzy modelling of trust and distrust has not considered the optimization of membership functions. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a continuous action-set learning automata (CALA)-based method to adjust membership functions of fuzzy trust and distrust during the lifetime of recommender system in terms of recommendation error. By assigning a CALA to the centre parameter of each triangular membership function, the proposed method optimizes the number and the position of fuzzy sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in this direction. The experimental results indicate that using the proposed method in fuzzy recommender systems improves the recommendation accuracy.},

First, we achieve better selection of higher-quality raters by our proposed trust-calculation method and an improved pheromone-update mechanism. Second, we can improve the prediction step by converting raters' ratings into a target user's perspective view and considering the influence level of each rater on the active user.

abstract = {In recent years, recommender systems have become an important tool for increasing sales and revenues for many online retailers, such as Amazon and eBay. Many of these recommender systems predict a user's interest in the items or the products by using the browsing/shopping history or item rating records of the user. However, many research studies show that, before making a purchase, people often read on-line reviews and exchange their opinion with friends in their social circles. The resulting electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has huge impact on customer's final purchase or decision. Nonetheless, most of the recommender systems in the current literature do not consider eWOM, let alone the effect of its propagation. Therefore, we propose a new recommendation model based on the collective matrix factorization technique for predicting customer's preferences in this paper. Our model not only considers customers' personal taste, their trust relationships, but also the effect of eWOM propagation in their social networks. We conduct a series of experiments using real-life data crawled from Epinions and Amazon. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms other closely related models that do not consider eWOM propagation effects by 5%-13% in terms of both RMSE and MAE.},

Recommender systems using collaborative filtering, have been emerged to guide and support users in choosing the needed product among the massive volume of information. Recommender systems based on trust, using the grants of trust or combining them with the grants of similarity, provide some recommendations. In a situation where user receives the suggestions from people whom he knows or are similar to himself, has more trust comparing with the situation where the suggestion is just based on similarity with others. In this paper, a hybrid recommender system, based on trust with individual and group views is presented. Individual trust is calculated based on item points which is earned by users. Group trust also, with regard to a particular method in clustering, puts in one group the users who have similar tastes in selecting items. Finally, the system puts these two views beside the factor of similarity and proposes to offer. Assessments carried out in this paper show that the proposed model compared to other models of collaborative filtration, has significantly increased the prediction accuracy.},

A key challenge of recommendation systems in sharing economy is to employ prediction algorithms to estimate the matching items with considering their interests and needs. The environment-context has been recognized as an important factor to consider in personalized recommender systems. Since dynamic information in environment-context describes the situation of items and users, the information affects the user's decision process essentially to apply in recommender systems. However, most model-based collaborative filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide an easy way of integrating context information into the model. In this paper, we introduce a Multidimensional Trust model based on Tensor Factorization. The generalization of Matrix Factorization allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information. According to the different types of context, the Multidimensional Trust model considers the additional dimensions for the representation of the data as a tensor. This is achieved by going through the collecting user's behavior based on rating analysis and identification of users' historical activity and viewing patterns. The benefits behavior solutions, which use the handle intelligently to meet the users' needs, are the focus of this paper.},

This arise a research focus about blending of the trust information and trust level prediction to the recommendation framework. From the past decade, numerous researches were done to adapt online social network trust (simply social trust) for many web applications, including e-commerce, P2P networks, multi-agent systems, recommendation systems, and service-oriented computing. Usually, online social trust prediction can be based on two mechanisms to acquire trust value: evaluating trustee on basis of truster/truster's neighbor trust experience information (local trust), otherwise evaluating trustee on the basis of the whole social network trust experience information as reputation (global trust). Here, we leverage social science theories to develop the trust models that enable the study of online social trust evolution. In this paper, we propose a matrix factorization based trust enhanced recommendation system which properly incorporates both local trust and global trust with diffusion of the social trust multi-aspects to improve the quality of recommendations for mitigating the data sparsity and the cold-start issues. Through experiments on the Epinions data set, we show that our model outperforms its standard trust enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy on recommender systems.},

By leveraging Semantic Web standards and technologies, a growing amount of semantic content has been published on the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD). The LOD cloud has made available a large volume of structured data in a range of domains via liberal licenses. The semantic content of LOD in conjunction with the advanced searching and querying mechanisms provided by SPARQL has opened up unprecedented opportunities not only for enhancing existing applications, but also for developing new and innovative semantic applications. However, SPARQL is inadequate to deal with functionalities such as comparing, prioritizing, and ranking search results which are fundamental to applications such as recommendation provision, matchmaking, social network analysis, visualization, and data clustering. This paper addresses this problem by developing a systematic measurement model of semantic similarity between resources in Linked Data. By drawing extensively on a feature-based definition of Linked Data, it proposes a generalized information content-based approach that improves on previous methods which are typically restricted to specific knowledge representation models and less relevant in the context of Linked Data. It is validated and evaluated for measuring item similarity in recommender systems. The experimental evaluation of the proposed measure shows that our approach can outperform comparable recommender systems that use conventional similarity measures.},

Collaborative filtering as a well-known technique in recommender systems often encounters some challenges such as spare rating data and malicious attacks. Trust-based collaborative filtering employs the social trust network to make recommendations in order to alleviate the above problems. Unfortunately, explicit trust information is quite deficient, which leads to the limited recommendation capability. Therefore, a latent social trust network model is proposed to improve the recommendation performance. The latent social trust comes from the coupling trust and the co-citation trust as well as the similar interests between users. Based on the latent trust information, a new social trust network can be built and then be used to predict the target user's taste. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can rationally infer the trust relationships between users and highly improve the recommendation performance.},

Collaborative filtering is one of the most commonly used algorithms in recommendation systems. This research leverages the abilities of collaborative filtering by introducing trust-based and social factors to modify existing similarity and neighborhood measures. Using this hybrid approach, a 45% reduction in error rate has been shown as measured by root mean squared error, comparing baseline collaborative filtering with trust-aware collaborative filtering. The experiments in this research have been conducted using multiple variables in collaborative filtering including neighborhood size, and threshold values in neighborhood formation sub-process. Moreover, experiments were also conducted on multiple similarity measures to identify the best combination of neighborhood formation and similarity that gives an optimal solution in a social trust context.},

abstract = {It is well-known that recommendation system which is widely used in many e-commerce platforms to recommend items to the right users suffers from data sparsity, imbalanced rating and cold start problems. Matrix factorization is a good way to deal with the sparsity and imbalance problems, which is however unable to make prediction for new users due to the lack of auxiliary information. With the advent of online social networks, the trust relation in the social network can be utilized as auxiliary data to solve the aforementioned problems since consumers' buying behavior is usually affected by the people around them. This paper reports a study of exploiting the trust relationship in social network for personalized recommendation. Although previous studies have paid attention to this topic, we improve the quality of recommendation further and solve the cold start problem better. To this end, we propose a recommendation system in social network with Feature Transfer and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (FTMF). The auxiliary data and matrix factorization technique are integrated to learn a social latent feature vector of users which represents the features transferred from trusted people. And an adaptive firm factor is introduced to balance the impact from user's own factors and trusted people on buying behavior for each user. The experimental results show that our model can effectively use the auxiliary data and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art social network based recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Social recommendation takes advantage of the inuence of social relationships in decision making and the ready avail- ability of social data through social networking systems. Trust relationships in particular can be exploited in such sys- tems for rating prediction and recommendation, which has been shown to have the potential for improving the quality of the recommender and alleviating the issue of data sparsity, cold start, and adversarial attacks. An appropriate trust in- ference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust- aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2- D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the build- ing blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is ca- pable of handling trust relationship in large networks. The inferred trust relationships can enlarge the knowledge base for trust information and improve the quality of trust-aware recommendation.},

abstract = {In most real-world scenarios, the ultimate goal of recommender system applications is to suggest a short ranked list of items, namely top-N recommendations, that will appeal to the end user. Often, the problem of computing top-N recommendations is mainly tackled with a two-step approach. The system focuses first on predicting the unknown ratings, which are eventually used to generate a ranked recommendation list. Actually, the top-N recommendation task can be directly seen as a ranking problem where the main goal is not to accurately predict ratings but to directly find the best-ranked list of items to recommend. In this article we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top-N recommendations exploiting freely available knowledge in the Web of Data. In particular, we employ DBpedia, a well-known encyclopedic knowledge base in the Linked Open Data cloud, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute top-N recommendations in a learning-to-rank fashion. Experiments with three datasets related to different domains (books, music, and movies) prove the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are used to find preferences of people or to predict the ratings with the help of information available from other users. The most widely used collaborative filtering recommender system by the e-commerce sites suffers from both the sparsity and cold-start problem due to insufficient data. Most of the existing systems consider only the ratings of the similar users and they do not give any preferences to the social behavior of users which shall aid the recommendations made to the user to a great extent. In this paper, instead of finding similarity from rating information, we propose a new approach which predicts the ratings of items by considering directed and transitive trust with timestamps and profile similarity from the social network along with the user-rated information. In cases where the trust and the rating details of users from the system is absent, we still make use of the social data of the users like the products liked by the user, user's social profile-education status, location etc.To make recommendation. Experimental analysis proves that our approach can improve the user recommendations at the extreme levels of sparsity in user-rating data. We also show that our approach works considerably well for cold-start users under the circumstances where collaborative filtering approach fails.},

The emergence of recommender system helps users to make decisions to a certain degree. So far, most of the studies pay much attention to designing or improving recommendation algorithms. However, few works consider the extraction of core users with whom recommender systems can generate satisfactory recommendation. In this paper, we propose new approaches to identifying core users based on trust relationships and interest similarity. The trust degree and interest similarity between all user pairs are calculated and sorted first, and two strategies based on frequency and weight of location are used to select core users. Experiments show the effectiveness of the extraction of core users and prove that 20% of core users enable recommender systems to achieve more than 90% of the accuracy of the top-N recommendation.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of open social networks, approaches incorporating social relationships into recommender systems are gaining momentum, especially matrix factorization-based ones. The experiments in previous literatures indicate that social information is very effective in improving the performance of traditional recommendation algorithms. However, most of existing social recommendation methods only take one kind of social relations—trust information into consideration, which is far from satisfactory. Furthermore, most of the existing trust networks are binary, which results in the equal treatment to different users who are trusted by the same user in these methods. In this paper, based on matrix factorization methods, we propose a new approach to make recommendation with social information. Its novelty can be summarized as follows: (1) it shows how to add different weights on the social trust relationships among users based on the trustee's competence and trustworthiness; (2) it incorporates the similarity relationships among users as a complement into the social trust relationships to enhance the computation of user's neighborhood; (3) it can balance the influence of these two kinds of relationships based on user's individuality adaptively. Experiments on Epinions and Ciao datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of mean absolute error and root mean square error, in particular for the users who rated a few items.},

This paper aims at calculating trust among users by identifying all possible relations that may exist among those users and evaluate them. Although many models were proposed to analyze computational trust in different applications of social web, little importance is given to the time factor even by models that represent trust as a source of recommendation measurement. Emphasized in this paper is the temporal factor and its role in improving the accuracy of trust in social recommender systems. We propose to integrate the temporal factor in measuring trust between social network friends.

So, when the recommender system goes wrong or suggests an irrelevant product, the customer will stop trusting and using the recommender system. This kind of scenario will affect the customer as well as the e-commerce and other websites that depends on recommender systems for boosting the sales.

In order to exploit the natural graph-based structure of RDF data, we study the impact of the knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation algorithm. In more detail, we investigate whether the integration of LOD-based features improves the effectiveness of the algorithm and to what extent the choice of different feature selection techniques in- uences its performance in terms of accuracy and diversity. The experimental evaluation on two state of the art datasets shows a clear correlation between the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize a specific evaluation metric. Moreover, the graph-based algorithm leveraging LOD-based features is able to overcome several state of the art baselines, such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, thus congfirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Consequently, recommendations are often not transparent to the user, are considered to be less trustworthy, or do not meet the user's situational needs.

An important feature pioneered by social tagging systems and later used in other kinds of social systems is the ability to explore different community relevance prospects by examining items bookmarked by a specific user or items associated by various users with a specific tag. A ranked list of recommended items offered by a specific recommender engine can be considered as another relevance prospect. The problem that we address is that existing personalized social systems do not allow their users to explore and combine multiple relevance prospects. Only one prospect can be explored atany given time-a listof recommended items, alistof items bookmarked by a specific user, or a list of items marked with a specific tag. In this article, we explore the notion of combining multiple relevance prospects as a way to increase effectiveness and trust. We used a visual approach to recommend articles at a conference by explicitly presenting multiple dimensions of relevance. Suggestions offered by different recommendation techniques were embodied as recommender agents to put them on the same ground as users and tags. The results of two user studies performed at academic conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces of personalized social systems. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection increase when users are able to explore and interrelate prospects of items relevance-that is, items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags. Nevertheless, a less-technical audience may require guidance to understand the rationale of such intersections.},

abstract = {The rapid development of the Internet and e-commerce has accumulated numerous data about products, services and customers, which contains meaningful information that recommender system can utilize to realize a more accurate recommendation. In daily life, it is nature for users to seek suggestion from a friend and the more professional and intimated the friend is, the more impact the suggestion has on the user's final decision. Inspired by this phenomenon, we develop a recommendation approach based on social trust network. In this paper, we take advantage of homogeneous effect in trust relations to calculate user similarities and build a personal weighted trust work. A trust propagation mechanism is proposed to attain trustworthy users and then we use a dynamic recommendation algorithm based on random walk model to achieve accurate recommendation. In the end, several comparing experiments are conducted to demonstrate the improvement of our recommendation method.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of online social network, people tend to express opinions and obtain information in social network. Due to the overwhelming amount of data in social network, users resort to recommendation system to find appropriate services or items. However, most current recommendation systems rely on the user to calculate the item evaluation results, which has many limitations in the item evaluation. To solve these limitations on item evaluation in social network, we put forward a new trust-based item evaluation model (called CTDR), which integrates trust, domain inclination and item reputation in this paper. First, we use the similarity between users, interaction, as well as the reputation of the target user to introduce a new trust computation method. Second, we introduce the concept of domain inclination and combine the domain activity of user and domain popularity to calculate the domain inclination. Third, we make use of the favorable rate of an item to compute the item reputation. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate CTDR with the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and performance of our trust-based item evaluation model.},

abstract = {Existing clustering-based recommendation methods generally focus on the clustering of users, items or social trust relationships. Although demonstrated to be efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets, these methods are sensitive to the quality of clustering and still suffer from the problem of low accuracy. In order to solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-type clustering based recommendation framework which systematically considers the trust-based user clustering, similarity-based user clustering and similarity-based item clustering to further improve the recommendation accuracy. A SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) signs-based community mining method is utilized to process the trust and distrust matrix in order to discover the trust-based user clusters. The PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis)-based model is employed to explore the similarity-based user and item clusters. Then a clustering-based trust regularization term is proposed to incorporate the trust-based user clusters into the matrix factorization model. Comparative experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can better address the issues of data sparsity and cold start, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of RMSE and MAE.},

Blended learning, or hybrid learning, is a formal educational program that integrates face-to-face learning with technology-based, digital instruction. On the other hand, Open Educational Resources (OER) provides a strategic opportunity to improve the quality of education as well as facilitate policy dialog, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. OERs are actual resources/tools that can help enrich any classroom environment and push student thinking and comprehension. One of the fundamental concepts of OER is "the ability to freely adapt and reuse existing pieces of knowledge", and therefore be a way to create more economic and personalized learning. The OER movement has challenged the traditional value chain by employing new methods to deliver high-quality educational content. The purpose of this work is to show a way to enhance the face-to-face classrooms with integration of OERs, and thus create blended learning instruction. Reuse of OERs by both individuals and organizations may have significant creative and economic benefit for learning environments. The approach is based on Linked Data for describe and publish OER. In this new paradigm for educational content consumption and integration, OER are expected to play a decisive and productive role for blended learning.

abstract = {The development of online social networks has increased the importance of social recommendations. Social recommender systems are based on the idea that users who are linked in a social trust network tend to share similar interests. Thus, how to build an accurate social trust network will greatly affect recommendation performance. However, existing trust-based recommender approaches do not fully utilize social information to build rational trust networks and thus have low prediction accuracy and slow convergence speed. In this paper, the authors propose a composite trust-based probabilistic matrix factorization model, which is mainly composed of two steps: In step 1, the existing explicit trust network and the inferred implicit trust network are used to build a composite trust network. In step 2, the composite trust network is used to minimize both the rating difference and the trust difference between the true value and the inferred value. Experiments based on an Epinions dataset show that the authors' approach has significantly higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than traditional collaborative filtering technology and the state-of-the-art trust-based recommendation approaches.},

abstract = {Trust-based recommendation systems study how people form opinions via trusted friends, so as to predict unknown ratings based on the ratings expressed by trusted friends. Most of the existing work only considers the ratings at the current time slot. In real life, a user's opinion evolves over time, since he receives the influence of different opinions sequentially. In addition, existing work usually targets a single user at a time; there is a need to predict multiple ratings for multiple connected users. To reach these ends, we propose a novel multiple-rating prediction scheme, FluidRating, which uses fluid dynamics theory to reveal the time-evolving formulation process of human opinions. In this scheme, each user corresponds to a container, and several containers are connected through single directional pipes, corresponding to influence relations. We identify three features of human personality in the opinion formulation and propagation process: "persistency" represents how much one insists on his opinion, "persuasiveness" represents the ability to impact others, and "forgetting" reflects the common truth that people have limited memory. The recommendation (or influence) is modeled as fluid with two dimensions: its temperature is taken as the "opinion/rating," and its height is deemed as the persistency. When new opinions emerge, each person refines his opinion through a round of fluid exchange with neighbors. Opinions of multiple rounds are aggregated to gain a final prediction. Experimental evaluation in a real data set validates the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {In recommender systems, user preferences can be acquired either explicitly by means of ratings, or implicitly-e.g., by processing text reviews, and by mining item browsing and purchasing records. Most existing collaborative filtering approaches have been designed to deal with numerical ratings, such as the 5-star ratings in Amazon and Netflix, for both rating prediction and item ranking (a.k.a. top-N recommendation) tasks. In many e-commerce and social network sites, however, user preferences are usually expressed in the form of binary and unary (positive-only) ratings, such as the thumbs up/down in YouTube and the likes in Facebook, respectively. Moreover, in these cases, the well-known problem of cold-start-i.e., the scarcity of user preferences-is highly remarkable. To address this situation, we explore a number of graph-based and matrix factorization recommendation models that jointly exploit user ratings and item metadata. In this work, such metadata are automatically obtained from DBpedia-the queriable and structured version of Wikipedia which is considered as the core knowledge repository of the Linked Open Data initiative-, and the models are evaluated with a Facebook dataset covering three distinct domains, namely books, movies and music. The results achieved in our experiments show that the proposed hybrid recommendation models, which exploit rating and semantic data, outperform content-based and collaborative filtering baselines.},

This paper examines the problem of social collaborative filtering to recommend items of interest to users in a social network setting. Many social networks capture the relationships among the nodes by using trust scores to label the edges. The bias of a node denotes its propensity to trust/mistrust its neighbors and is closely related to truthfulness. It is based on the idea that the recommendation of a highly biased node should be removed. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for recommendation employing matrix factorization after removing the bias nodes from each link, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. The empirical analysis on real large datasets demonstrate that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods.},

In the new trust model, the recommendation trust value of nodes can be more accurately calculated. Therefore the trust management model could describe the dynamic trusts of nodes, and it could help users to make decisions to select the transaction nodes, against malicious nodes and malicious recommendations.

In contrast, we focus on better utilizing these rating estimates in the operations of DVD-rental firms. We show that a more explicit consideration of inventory level and future demand can help the firms better manage demand, and can increase the number of satisfied customers substantially. However, if the uncertainty regarding inventory levels is high, the performance of one of our proposed approaches may be worse than the prevalent industry practice under certain conditions. We discuss these conditions and propose a quick recipe for dealing with high levels of variation in inventory estimation. We show that when it is not possible to estimate inventory levels reliably, it is better to underestimate rather than overestimate. Other findings include the trade-off between the short-term profitability of the firms and long-term customer trust; and the effect of variation in rating estimates on the quality of our solution approaches.},

But it is important for people who use these services to configure appropriate location-privacy preferences so that they can control to whom they want to share their location information. Manually configuring these preferences may be burdensome and confusing, and so location-privacy preference recommenders based on crowdsourcing preferences from other users have been proposed. Whether people will accept the recommended preferences acquired from other users, who they may not know or trust, has not, however, been investigated. In this paper, we present a user experiment (n=99) to explore what factors influence people's acceptance of locationprivacy preference recommenders. We find that 44% of our participants have privacy concerns about such recommenders. These concerns are shown to have a negative effect (p <0.001) on their acceptance of the recommendations and their satisfaction about their choices. Furthermore, users' acceptance of recommenders varies according to both context and recommendations being made. Our findings are potentially useful to designers of location-sharing services and privacy recommenders.},

The characteristics of social networks play a very important role towards behavioralmodeling of a trust network based Recommender System (RS). Similar to real world, in a social network also, it is important to objectively identify a member with high reputation who is heavily trusted by many members and hence his suggestions and inputs are most trust worthy for the whole community; that is, objective identification of leader is extremely important. In this paper, we propose a method to objectively identify leaders in a social network, we introduce new terms: Leadership score, prominence trust, peer inclusive factor, trust spread factor, trust maturity factor and trust penetration factors to portray a member more appropriately in a social network. We have calculated the leadership score using the real world dataset. Leadership score is taken as a linear additive function of prominence trust, engagement trust and peer inclusive factors with different weightage values. In our experiment, we have considered that leaders not only are followed by others, they are also socially engaged from their end to others in the social network. Prominence trust is a detailed characterization to get more accurate value of trust. Along with overall trust score, it is imperative to analyze more attributes to derive a more objective interpretation of the same. These attributes take care of trust score/reputation over period of time, number of trusting members, peer level interactions and also absolute score. To validate our leadership model in social network, we remove top 5%, 10% and top 20% of the members with high 'leadership score' and findout the reduction in the overall interactions. As further improvements to this work, a social network to be built with users and items and collect the data using positive and negative responses; use multiprogramming concepts to determine the optimum function for leadership score. This will aid towards further analysis and fine tuning of the models.},

Using this novel paradigm to capture 900 observations of targets' behavior (as trustworthy or untrustworthy), we found that face-based judgments predicted trustworthiness. We also found that this effect was mediated by targets' expectations of how other people would perceive them and by their intentions to act in accordance with those expectations. These results are consistent with an internalized-impressions account: Targets internalize other people's appearance-based expectations and act in accordance with them, which leads facial-appearance-based judgments to be accurate.},

The proposed system builds implicit trust based on the interrelation between an active user and his/ her friends in the popular social microblogger Twitter, by considering aspects such as retweet actions and followers/followings lists. The measured trust values are used to vote for friends' opinions held in the posted tweets about a certain product such as movies. The higher trust parameters to a friend the more his/her opinions anticipate in recommendations encounter. Firstly, Friends' opinions are obtained by a probabilistic sentiment analysis technique to extract the opinions in form of multi-point scale of ratings from short tweets. Secondly, trust relation aspects are extracted from user's friends accounts. Further, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize social trust parameters. Thirdly, this paper considers the Support Vector Regression algorithm (SVR) to predict ratings for the active user. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms several related works in terms of accuracy using real world data from Twitter.

abstract = {Rating aggregation is critical to the quality control of recommendation systems and its effectiveness is a deep concern of all users. However, there are some problems in existing recommendation systems. For example, some of the raters from certain source are much more stringent than others, leading the phenomena that some entities with better quality are rejected. In this paper, we propose a novel raNking-based multI-source ratiNg Aggregation (NINA) approach. In this approach, based on the collected social context of recommenders and recommendees, the credibility of rankings of ratings from multiple sources can be estimated, and it can be used to deal with the disagreement during ranking-based rating aggregation from multiple sources. Hence, the proposed approach can effectively estimate the 'true' rating during aggregation based on the ratings from multiple sources, even though no prior knowledge exists about the distribution of stringent raters and lenient raters in different sources. We have studied the properties of NINA empirically. In particular, the experiments illustrate that compared with existing approaches, our proposed NINA can significantly reduce the influence of ratings from stringent raters and lenient raters, leading to trust enhanced rating aggregation, no matter what kind of the distributions of stringent raters and lenient raters are.},

Little work has been done, however, on studying how much the contextual information affects the business performance. In this paper, we study how including context in recommendations affects customers' trust, sales, and other crucial business-related performance measures. To do this, we delivered content-based and context-aware recommendations through a live controlled experiment with real customers of a commercial European online publisher. We measured the recommendations' accuracy anddiversification, how much customers spent purchasing products during the experiment, the quantity and price of their purchases, and the customers' level of trust. We show that collecting and using contextual information in recommendations affects business-related performance measures, such as company sales, by improving the accuracy and diversification of recommendations, which in turn improves trust and, ultimately, business performance results.},

With recommender systems, customers can find their interested merchandise in a timely manner. It not only facilitates customers' purchases, but also promotes sales. While recommender systems can predict customers' preferences accurately, they suffer from privacy leakage in many aspects. In this paper, we study an attack model in centralized recommender systems and present a privacy-preserving recommendation framework to neutralize such attack. In this model, an attacker holds some of the real customers' ratings and attempts to obtain their private preferences. The proposed framework is based on the weighted nonnegative matrix tri-factorization technique. It utilizes customers' trustworthiness to filter out unrelated ratings so that their privacy can be preserved. We performed experiments on two different datasets with respect to recommendation precision and privacy preservation level. The results demonstrate that our recommender system can distinguish between real customers and attackers to a great extent without compromising the prediction accuracy.},

These issues hinder the recommender systems from providing more personalized recommendations to the users. In this paper, we propose a social trust model and use the probabilistic matrix factorization method to estimate users taste by incorporating user-item rating matrix. The effect of users friends tastes is modeled using a trust model which is defined based on importance (i.e., centrality) and similarity between users. Similarity is modeled using Vector Space Similarity (VSS) algorithm and centrality is quantified using two different centrality measures (degree and eigen-vector centrality). To validate the proposed method, rating estimation is performed on the Epinions dataset. Experiments show that our method provides better prediction when using trust relationship based on centrality and similarity values rather than using the binary values. The contributions of centrality and similarity in the trust values vary with different measures of centrality.},

The heterogeneity of IoT, along with other factors, poses a challenge when it comes to securing communication between these devices. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT trust and reputation model that employs distributed probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to classify trustworthy nodes from malicious ones. Our model tackles the cold start problem in IoT environments by predicting ratings for newly joined devices based on their characteristics and learns over time. Processing is completely distributed and is handled by the nodes themselves. This guarantees better availability, since there is no single point of failure. Moreover, our model can accommodate the various capabilities and types of IoT devices. Unlike other proposed models in the literature, our model provides different levels of security depending on the sensitivity of the data being transmitted.},

abstract = {Sufficient number of recommenders should be efficiently found for active users of the trust-aware recommender system (TARS). S-Searching is a newly proposed recommender searching mechanism for TARS based on the scale-freeness of the trust network. It first propagates the user trust from the active user to the skeleton, and then finds the recommenders via trust propagation from the skeleton, in which the skeleton is the collection of nodes with the highest degrees in the trust network. However, S-Searching does not consider the skeleton maintenance cost or the coverage overlap between the nodes of the skeleton. This paper proposes a recommender searching mechanism called OS-Searching to improve S-Searching by optimizing the skeleton selection strategy. OS-Searching uses the genetic algorithm to choose the most optimized skeleton. It can achieve the maximum prediction coverage with the minimum skeleton maintenance cost. Simulation results show that compared with S-Searching, OS-Searching can reduce the skeleton maintenance cost by more than 90% with reasonable prediction coverage.},

Since offering the most appropriate expertise to the customer is one of the clear objectives in Expert Cloud, colleague recommendation is a necessary part of it. So, the purpose of this paper is to develop a colleague recommender system for the Expert Cloud using features matrices of colleagues. Design/methodology/approach: The new method is described in two phases. In the first phase, all possible colleagues of the user are found through the filtering mechanism and next features of the user and possible colleagues are calculated and collected in matrices. Six potential features of colleagues including reputation, expertise, trust, agility, cost and field of study were proposed. In the second phase, the final score is calculated for every possible colleague and then top-k colleagues are extracted among users. The survey was conducted using a simulation in MATLAB Software. Data were collected from Expert Cloud website. The method was tested using evaluating metrics such as precision, accuracy, incorrect recommendation and runtime. Findings: The results of this study indicate that considering more features of colleagues has a positive impact on increasing the precision and accuracy of recommending new colleagues. Also, the proposed method has a better result in reducing incorrect recommendation. Originality/value: In this paper, the colleague recommendation issue in the Expert Cloud is pointed out and the solution approach is applied into the Expert Cloud website.},

abstract = {In existing recommendation systems, there exist the issues of 'cold start' and 'excessively mature recommendation,' which cause the recommendation systems to have weak effectiveness; thus, a trust-based recommendation model with a small recommendation probability for unknown items (RM-UI) is proposed for social networks. In the RM-UI scheme, the recommendation values of items are primarily derived from the probabilities calculated by a similar mature recommendation system during the initiation stage of the recommendation system. Thus, the 'cold start' phenomenon can be overcome. When the recommendation system enters the period of maturation, the recommendation probabilities mainly adopt the recommendation values computed by the self-system. However, in the existing recommendation systems, there remains the problem of 'excessively mature recommendation,' which causes the system to lose the opportunity to recommend more optimized items. Thus, in the RM-UI scheme, except for recommending items with higher recommendation probabilities, we recommend items with lower recommendation probabilities with a small probability to enable those items that can bring greater welfare to recommendation systems to be recommended. This breaks the weakness of a confined recommendation that exists in previous recommendation systems, and it enlarges the welfare of the system. After theoretical analysis, it has been proven that the RM-UI scheme can achieve greater welfare than the previous recommendation scheme and gain more vitality. Experiments based on real social network data are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the RM-UI scheme: in the initiation stage, the performance criteria of precision ratio, recall ratio, and F1-measure are improved by approximately 21.08%, 21.57%, and 21.32%, respectively, over the previous schemes, and in the mature stage, although the three indications are similar to those of the previous schemes, the improvement in the overall revenue of the system is 17.6%.},

In order to retrieve user most prefer attractions from a large number of tourism information, location-based personalized recommendation technology has been widely concerned in academic and industry. For the solving techniques problems such as data sparsity and cold-start existed in personalized recommendation system, this paper proposes a personalized location recommendation model-SocInflu, which combines user collaborative filtering technology with social networks factor. This method fully exploits social relations and trust relations between users and recommends users most interest attractions by the means of social influence and position information between user and tourism attractions.

abstract = {Recommender Systems based on collaborative filtering could provide users with accurate recommendation. However, sometimes due to data sparsity and cold start of the input ratings matrix, this method could not find similar users accurately. In the past, researchers used implicit trust weight instead of the similarity weight to find similar users, to improve the quality of recommendation [17]. And they often ignore the role of explicit trust in the process of finding similar users. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the calculation of implicit trust and explicit trust. Then according to their role in the recommendation system, we propose a method that combined trust and similarity to get a better recommendation. At last, by experimenting on FilmTrust [5] data set which has the explicit trust matrix, the result showed that the method we proposed significantly improve the quality of recommendation, in addition, implicit trust and explicit trust have a positive effect on the quality of the results of recommendation.},

In this paper,we propose a probabilistic topic model that incorporates user interests,item representation and context information in a single framework. In our approach,the contextual information is represented as a subset of the items feature space which is acquired from the knowledge available in the Linked Open Data (LOD). We use DBpedia,a well-known knowledge base in LOD,to utilize the context information in recommendation. Our proposed recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user preferences and the additional context. We use these probabilities as recommendation scores to find top-n items for recommendations.

Here both risk perceptions towards data security and privacy as well as trust in safe technical systems play a central and specific role, particularly in the clinical context. These aspects dominate acceptance of such systems. By using a Doctor-in-the- Loop approach some of these difficulties could be mitigated by combining both human expertise with computer efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a social content recommendation method based on spatial-temporal aware controlled information diffusion modeling in OSNs. Users interact more frequently when they are close to each other geographically, have similar behaviors, and fall into similar demographic categories. Considering these facts, we propose multicriteria-based social ties relationship and temporal-aware probabilistic information diffusion modeling for controlled information spread maximization in OSNs. The proposed social ties relationship modeling takes into account user spatial information, content trust, opinion similarity, and demographics. We suggest a ranking algorithm that considers the user ties strength with friends and friends-of-friends to rank users in OSNs and select highly influential injection nodes. These nodes are able to improve social content recommendations, minimize information diffusion time, and maximize information spread. Furthermore, the proposed temporal-aware probabilistic diffusion process categorizes the nodes and diffuses the recommended content to only those users who are highly influential and can enhance information dissemination. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {Background: Key opinion leaders (KOLs) are people who can influence public opinion on a certain subject matter. In the field of medical and health informatics, it is critical to identify KOLs on various disease conditions. However, there have been very few studies on this topic. Objective: We aimed to develop a recommender system for identifying KOLs for any specific disease with health care data mining. Methods: We exploited an unsupervised aggregation approach for integrating various ranking features to identify doctors who have the potential to be KOLs on a range of diseases. We introduce the design, implementation, and deployment details of the recommender system. This system collects the professional footprints of doctors, such as papers in scientific journals, presentation activities, patient advocacy, and media exposure, and uses them as ranking features to identify KOLs. Results: We collected the information of 2,381,750 doctors in China from 3,657,797 medical journal papers they published, together with their profiles, academic publications, and funding. The empirical results demonstrated that our system outperformed several benchmark systems by a significant margin. Moreover, we conducted a case study in a real-world system to verify the applicability of our proposed method. Conclusions: Our results show that doctors' profiles and their academic publications are key data sources for identifying KOLs in the field of medical and health informatics. Moreover, we deployed the recommender system and applied the data service to a recommender system of the China-based Internet technology company NetEase. Patients can obtain authority ranking lists of doctors with this system on any given disease.},

They are not only used to filter large item sets or point users to unknown but relevant items, their recommendations can also help users to make a decision given a limited choice set. Such a system is usually considered effective if the users adopt the recommendations because, for example, the system's suggestions match their preferences or because they generally trust in the system's benevolence and competence. With this work we aim to further explore the persuasive potential of automated recommendations. Our specific goal was to investigate whether the mere presence of a recommendation has effects on the user's choice process. We conducted two online studies in which participants received either no recommendation or a random recommendation for a given decision scenario. The obtained results showed that the pure existence of recommendations can, depending on the decision scenario, make users more confident in their choices and reduce choice difficulty. Furthermore, we observed that in both studies even random recommendations led to an anchoring effect as the participants' choices were measurably biased by the characteristics of the recommended item.},

In other words,to what extent does a user accept recommendations in social networks need to consider the user's own knowledge or expertise in the field. In this paper,we propose a novel matrix factorization recommendation algorithm based on integrating social network information such as trust relationships,rating information of users and users' own knowledge. Specifically,we first use a user's status (in this paper,status refers to the number of followers and the number of ratings one has done) in a social network to indicate a user's knowledge in a field since we cannot directly measure a user's knowledge in the field. Then,we model the final rating of decision-making as a linear combination of the user's own preferences,social influence and user's own knowledge.

abstract = {Recommender systems(RS) are a type of solution to the information overload problem suffered by users of websites that allow the rating of certain items. Collaborative filtering(CF) is one of the most widely used methods in personalized RS. The most critical part of collaborative filtering is to compute similarities among users using a user-item rating matrix based on which recommendations can be generated. However, CF suffers from several inherent issues, such as data sparsity and cold start, which affect the quality of recommendation seriously. To address these problems, we propose a reconstructing trust matrix measure in this paper, which combines user similarity and weighted trust propagation. Specifically, we first remove the trust relationship of those users whose similarity falls below a certain threshold. We then add the users that are not in the trust matrix into it when the similarity between them exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, weighted trust propagation is considered, aiming to distinguish trusted neighbors in a shorter distance with those in a longer distance and incorporate more trusted neighbors, especially useful for cold users. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that our method achieves superior accuracy and it can solve cold user problem as well.},

abstract = {The use of pervasive computing technologies for advertising purposes is an interesting emergent field for large, medium, and small companies. Although recommender systems have been a traditional solution to decrease users' cognitive effort to find good and personalized items, the classic collaborative filtering needs to include contextual information to be more effective. The inclusion of users' social context information in the recommendation algorithm, specifically trust in other users, may be a mechanism for obtaining ads' influence from other users in their closest social circle. However, there is no consensus about the variables to use during the trust inference process, and its integration into a classic collaborative filtering recommender system deserves a deeper research. On the other hand, the pervasive advertising domain demands a recommender system evaluation from a novelty/precision perspective. The improvement of the precision/novelty balance is not only a matter related to the recommendation algorithm itself but also a better recommendations' display strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a collaborative filtering recommender system based on trust, which was tested throughout a digital signage prototype using a multiscreen scheme for recommendations delivery to evaluate our proposal using a novelty/precision approach.},

Most of the existing matrix factorization (MF) based algorithms for social recommender systems factorize rating matrix into two low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an improved factorization machines (FMs) with social information, called SocialFM. Our approach can effectively simulate the influence propagation by estimating interactions between categorical variables and specifying the input feature vectors. We combine user trust value with similarity to compute the influence value between users. We also present social regularization and model regularization to impose constraint on the objective function. Our approach is a general method, which can be easily extended to incorporate other context like user mood, timestamp, location, etc. The experiment results show that our approach outperforms other state-ofthe- art recommendation methods.},

abstract = {The maturity of the smartphone and the World Wide Web (www) technologies have driven many social network applications which have facilitated people to share text and multimedia contents. The social networks that facilitate users to share the check-in (location visit) information are known as the location-based social networks (LBSN)s and provide various information for a recommendation problem that spans beyond the user-location ratings, and comments. For instance, the time of the check-in, the category of the POI, the distance of POI from the user's home, the user's friends' visit to that place, and so forth. It's worthwhile to explore and efficiently integrate such information for the desired purpose. A Point of Interest (POI) recommendation system uses a user's historical check-in information from LBSNs and recommends the list of places that are potential for future visits. Many of the existing POI recommendation systems have focused on either of the temporal (time of the check-in), the geographical/spatial (distance between check-in locations), or the social (friendship, and trust based) aspects. Incorporation of all the major aspects (the categorical, the geographical, the social, and the temporal) of check-ins into a single model is barely explored by other studies. In this paper, we propose a fused model termed GeoTeCS (Geographical Temporal Categorical and Social) for personalized location recommendation. GeoTeCS uses the matrix factorization technique to fuse the major check-in aspects into a recommendation model. The contributions of this paper are: (i) it proposes a matrix factorization based location recommender that incorporates all the major aspects-The categorical, the geographical, the social, and the temporal aspects into a single model and (ii) it extensively evaluates the proposed model against two realworld datasets-the Gowalla, and the Weeplaces, to illustrate its effectiveness.},

The paper addresses this research gap by introducing the prototype SKOS Recommender (SKOSRec), which produces scalable on-the-fly recommendations through SPARQL-like queries from Linked Data repositories. The SKOSRec query language enables users to obtain constraint-based, aggregation-based and cross-domain recommendations, such that results can be adapted to specific business or customer requirements.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, personalized recommendation has become an important research issue in social networks as it can find and match user's preference. In this paper, the user trust is integrated into the recommendation algorithm, by dividing the user trust into 2 parts: user score trust and user preference trust. In view of the common items in user item score matrix, the algorithm combines the number of items with the score similarity between users, and establishes an asymmetric trust relationship matrix so as to calculate the user's score trust. For the non-common score items, we use the attribute information of items and the scoring weight to calculate the user's preference trust. Based on the user trust in social network, a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is proposed. Besides, a new matrix factorization recommendation algorithm is proposed by combining the user trust with matrix factorization. We did the experiments comparing with the related algorithms on the real data sets of social network. The results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendation.},

abstract = {Cross-domain recommender systems are usually able to suggest items, which are not in the same domain, where users provided ratings. For this reason, cross-domain recommendation has attracted more and more attention in recent years. However, most studies propose to make cross-domain recommendation in the scenario, where there are common ratings between different domains. The scenario without common ratings is seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the cross-domain recommendation problem in such a scenario. We first apply trust relations to the cross-domain scenario for predicting coarse ratings pertaining to cross-domain items. Then, we build a new rating matrix, including known ratings and predicted ratings of items from different domains, and transform a user-item matrix into an item-item association matrix. Finally, we compute the similarities of items belonging to different domains and use item-based collaborative filtering to generate recommendations. Through relevant experiments on a real-world data set, we compare our method to a trust-aware recommendation method and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of prediction accuracy, recall, and coverage.},

abstract = {Although recommender systems have been comprehensively analysed in the past decade, the study of social-based recommender have not been studied fully. Many social networks capture the relationships among the nodes by using trust scores to label the edges. The bias of a node denotes its propensity to trust/mistrust its neighbours and is closely related to truthfulness. It is based on the idea that the recommendation of a highly biased node should be removed. In this paper, we compute the bias and prestige of nodes in networks where the edge weight denotes the trust score. We propose a model-based approach for recommendation employing matrix factorisation after removing the bias nodes from each link, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favours together. Through experiments on publicly available data, we demonstrate that the proposed recommendation models can better utilise user's social trust information, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy.},

Firstly, we exploit fuzzy trust among users through fuzzy computational model of trust and incorporate it into context-aware CF (CACF) technique for better recommendations. Secondly, we use fuzzy trust propagation for alleviating sparsity problem to further improve recommendations quality.

abstract = {The Linked Open Data cloud has been increasing in popularity, with DBpedia as a first-class citizen in this cloud that has been widely adopted across many applications. Measuring similarity between resources and identifying their relatedness could be used for various applications such as item-based recommender systems. To this end, several similarity measures such as LDSD (Linked Data Semantic Distance) were proposed.However, some fundamental axioms for similarity measures such as “equal self-similarity”, “symmetry” or “minimality” are violated, and property similarities have been ignored. Moreover, none of the previous studies have provided a comparative study on other similarity measures. In this paper, we present a similarity measure, called Resim (Resource Similarity), based on top of a revised LDSD similarity measure. Resim aims to calculate the similarity of any resources in DBpedia by taking into account the similarity of the properties of these resources as well as satisfying the fundamental axioms. In addition, we evaluate our similarity measure with two state-of-the-art similarity measures (LDSD and Shakti) in terms of calculating the similarities for general resources (i.e., any resources without a domain restriction) in DBpedia and resources for music artist recommendations. Results show that our similarity measure can resolve some of the limitations of state-of-the-art similarity measures and performs better than them for calculating the similarities between general resources and music artist recommendations.},

abstract = {Trust is an essential necessity in Online Social Networks (OSNs) because of their current pervasive usage in sharing information on the Web. The traditional methods of measuring trust in social networks using heuristics or by manual methods are computationally expensive and sometimes do not offer reliable and scalable results. Recently, researchers resort to the use OSNs properties to model real life events because the interrelationships on these sites encode some human behaviors that resemble their off-line ones. Trust on these sites can, therefore, be measured by taking into consideration the social relationship and ties embeddedness within the underlying user graph. To this end, we study the distribution nature of "common friends", the network mixing, average clustering coefficient and scale-free behaviors of 4 OSNs. The study shows that the distribution of "common friends" on OSNs follows a power law. Furthermore, to measure trust using these metrics, we proposed mathematical frameworks and analysis to support our claim. The findings show that these metrics have the ability to measure the level of trust on an unknown user on a social network of trust. These results will further help redefine and develop more reliable, fast and trust inference algorithms and recommender systems for online products and auction sales, email spam detection algorithms, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the statistical distribution of "common friends" on OSNs and demonstrated how they can be exploited for trust inference.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the activities of users is an important one for recommender systems and analyses of social media. User activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three or more things (e.g. when a user tags items on a webpage or tweets about a location he or she visited). Such relationships can be represented as a tensor, and tensor factorization is becoming an increasingly important means for predicting users' possible activities. However, the prediction accuracy of factorization is poor for ambiguous and/or sparsely observed objects. Our solution, Semantic Sensitive Tensor Factorization (SSTF), incorporates the semantics expressed by an object vocabulary or taxonomy into the tensor factorization. SSTF first links objects to classes in the vocabulary (taxonomy) and resolves the ambiguities of objects that may have several meanings. Next, it lifts sparsely observed objects to their classes to create augmented tensors. Then, it factorizes the original tensor and augmented tensors simultaneously. Since it shares semantic knowledge during the factorization, it can resolve the sparsity problem. Furthermore, as a result of the natural use of semantic information in tensor factorization, SSTF can combine heterogeneous and unbalanced datasets from different Linked Open Data sources. We implemented SSTF in the Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization framework. Experiments on publicly available large-scale datasets using vocabularies from linked open data and a taxonomy from WordNet show that SSTF has up to 12% higher accuracy in comparison with state-of-the-art tensor factorization methods.},

Current recommender systems still suffer from inaccurate or erroneous predictions for users. This may be due to lack of consensus between users who provide different opinions on items after purchase. However, it is possible that this problem might be due to the users having no/few knowledge on the items or they might have had diverse reasons for previous purchase of the items. Therefore, they decide to either provide untruthful opinions on the items or to not even provide their opinions on the items. This demo paper presents a proposed approach to recommendation, where trust information from the social network can be used to motivate or influence users to contribute their opinions for future recommendation.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) We elaborate how social relationships can be incorporated into review rating prediction and propose a trust-based rating prediction model using proximity as trust weight, and (2) We design a trust-aware detection model based on rating variance which iteratively calculates user-specific overall trustworthiness scores as the indicator for spamicity. Experiments on the dataset collected from Yelp.com show that the proposed trust-based prediction achieves a higher accuracy than standard CF method, and there exists a strong correlation between social relationships and the overall trustworthiness scores.},

However, there are serious data sparsity in users rating data. As the Internet continues to penetrate on people's lives, social networks have become an indispensable part of life. Friends trust relationships in social network can help alleviate the problem of sparse rating data and improve the performance of the recommendation system. Therefore, a Real-Valued Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (R_CRBM) model is proposed in this paper. In the R_CRBM model, rating data does not need to be converted to a K dimensional 0-1 vector unit. Meanwhile, the training process of R_CRBM model also uses rated/unrated information. Moreover, the nearest trusted relationships are applied to the R_CRBM model in the recommended process. The experimental results from Baidu and Epinions datasets show that the R_CRBM model and the nearest trusted relationships help to improve the prediction accuracy of the recommendation system. Finally, due to a common platform is very difficult to train R_CRBM model in big data. Therefore, a parallelization scheme based on Spark is also proposed in this paper. The experimental result shows that the parallelization method for R_CRBM is a good solution for this problem.},

abstract = {Information overload is a problem we daily experience when accessing information channels such as a Web site, a mobile application or even our set-top box. There is a clear need for applications able to guide users through an apparently chaotic information space thus filtering, in a personalized way, only those elements that may result of interest to them. Together with the transformation of the Web from a distributed and hyperlinked repository of documents to a distributed repository of structured knowledge, in the last years, a new generation of recommendation engines has emerged. As of today, we have a huge amount of RDF data published as Linked Open Data (LOD) and available via a SPARQL endpoint and the number of applications able to exploit the knowledge they encoe is growing consistently. Among these new applications and services, recommender systems are gaining positions in the LOD arena.},

Therefore, rating predictions are critical for qualified recommendations. In this paper, based on the fluid dynamics theory, we propose a novel rating prediction scheme called DynFluid. The key observation is that the rating of a user depends on his/her user experience, as well as the ratings of other users. For example, users may refer to friends' ratings upon rating a product, themselves. DynFluid analogizes the rating reference among the users to the fluid flow among containers: each user is represented by a container, the rating of a user is mapped to be the fluid temperature in the corresponding container. Two user characteristics, persistency and persuasiveness, are also incorporated into DynFluid. Finally, real data-driven experiments in Epinions and Ciao validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DynFluid.},

This approach allows the recommender system to make an increased number of accurate predictions, especially in circumstances where users and items have few ratings.

This approach overcomes the overlooked use of OSNs in Recommender Systems (RSs) and utilizes the widely available information from such networks. Bearing in mind that a user's selection is greatly influenced by his/her trusted friends and their opinions, this paper presents a framework to apply a new source of data to personalise recommendations by mining their friends' short text posts in microbloggings. ISTS maps suggested recommendations into numerical rating scales by applying three main components: (1) measuring the implicit trust between friends based on the intercommunication activities; (2) inferring the sentiment rating to reflect the knowledge behind friends' short posts, so-called micro-reviews, using sentiment techniques adding several ONSs language features to empower the extracted sentiment; (3) identifying the impact degree of trust level between friends and sentiment rating from micro-reviews on recommendations by using machine learning regression algorithms including linear regression, random forest and support vector regression (SVR). Our framework takes into consideration the semantic relationships between rating categories when estimating ratings to users. Empirical results, using real social data from Twitter microblogger, verified the effectiveness and promises of ISTS.},

abstract = {Trust as one of important social relations has attracted much attention from researchers in the field of social network-based recommender systems. In trust network-based recommender systems, there exist normally two roles for users, truster and trustee. Most of trust-based methods generally utilize explicit links between truster and trustee to find similar neighbors for recommendation. However, there possibly exist implicit correlations between users, especially for users with the same role (truster or trustee). In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Filtering method called CF-TC, which exploits Trust Context to discover implicit correlation between users with the same role for recommendation. In this method, each user is first represented by the same-role users who are co-occurring with the user. Then, similarities between users with the same role are measured based on obtained user representation. Finally, two variants of our method are proposed to fuse these computed similarities into traditional collaborative filtering for rating prediction. Using two publicly available real-world Epinions and Ciao datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments to compare the performance of our proposed method with some existing benchmark methods. The results show that CF-TC outperforms other baseline methods in terms of RMSE, MAE, and recall.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been studied comprehensively in both academic and industrial fields over the past decade. As user interests can be affected by context at any time and any place in mobile scenarios, rich context information becomes more and more important for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent, they suffer several inherent weaknesses: (1) Users' context-aware interests are not modeled realistically, which reduces the recommendation quality; (2) Current context-aware recommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actually context-aware and associated with certain aspects (i.e., categories of items) in mobile scenarios. In this article, we define a term role to model common context-aware interests among a group of users. We propose an efficient role mining algorithm to mine roles from a "user-context-behavior" matrix, and a role-based trust model to calculate context-aware trust value between two users. During online recommendation, given a user u in a context c, an efficient weighted set similarity query (WSSQ) algorithm is designed to build u's role-based trust network in context c. Finally, we make recommendations to u based on u's role-based trust network by considering both context-aware roles and trust relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our recommendation approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.},

abstract = {Increasing interactions and engagements in social networks through monetary and material incentives is not always feasible. Some social networks, specifically those that are built on the basis of fairness, cannot incentivize members using tangible things and thus require an intangible way to do so. In such networks, a personalized recommender could provide an incentive for members to interact with other members in the community. Behavior-based trust models that generally compute social trust values using the interactions of a member with other members in the community have proven to be good for this. These models, however, largely ignore the interactions of those members with whom a member has interacted, referred to as "friendship effects." Results from social studies and behavioral science show that friends have a significant influence on the behavior of the members in the community. Following the famous Spanish proverb on friendship "Tell Me Your Friends and I Will Tell You Who You Are," we extend our behavior-based trust model by incorporating the "friendship effect" with the aim of improving the accuracy of the recommender system. In this article, we describe a trust propagation model based on associations that combines the behavior of both individual members and their friends. The propagation of trust in our model depends on three key factors: the density of interactions, the degree of separation, and the decay of friendship effect. We evaluate our model using a real data set and make observations on what happens in a social network with and without trust propagation to understand the expected impact of trust propagation on the ranking of the members in the recommended list. We present the model and the results of its evaluation. This work is in the context of moderated networks for which participation is by invitation only and in which members are anonymous and do not know each other outside the community.},

abstract = {The reliability of delivering packets through multi-hop intermediate nodes is a significant issue in the mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The distributed mobile nodes establish connections to form the MANET, which may include selfish and misbehaving nodes. Recommendation based trust management has been proposed in the literature as a mechanism to filter out the misbehaving nodes while searching for a packet delivery route. However, building a trust model that adopts recommendations by other nodes in the network is a challenging problem due to the risk of dishonest recommendations like bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and collusion. This paper investigates the problems related to attacks posed by misbehaving nodes while propagating recommendations in the existing trust models. We propose a recommendation based trust model with a defence scheme, which utilises clustering technique to dynamically filter out attacks related to dishonest recommendations between certain time based on number of interactions, compatibility of information and closeness between the nodes. The model is empirically tested under several mobile and disconnected topologies in which nodes experience changes in their neighbourhood leading to frequent route changes. The empirical analysis demonstrates robustness and accuracy of the trust model in a dynamic MANET environment.},

In recent years, researchers are paying increasing attention to aggregate diversity as a key metric beyond accuracy, because improving aggregate recommendation diversity may increase long tails and sales diversity. Trust is often used to improve recommendation accuracy. However, how to utilize trust to improve aggregate recommendation diversity is unexplored. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem and propose a novel trust-aware recommendation method by incorporating time factor into similarity computation. The rationale underlying the proposed method is that, trustees with later creation time of trust relation can bring more diverse items to recommend to their trustors than other trustees with earlier creation time of trust relation. Through relevant experiments on publicly available dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in terms of aggregate diversity while maintaining almost the same recall.},

They begin by defining five basic tasks that can be performed using social networks: (1) link prediction; (2) pathway and community formation; (3) recommendation and decision support; (4) risk analysis; and (5) planning, especially causal interventional planning. Next, they discuss frameworks for using predictive analytics, availability of annotation, text associated with (or produced within) a social network, information propagation history (e.g., upvotes and shares), trust, and reputation data. They also review challenges such as imbalanced and partial data, concept drift especially as it manifests within social media, and the need for active learning, online learning, and transfer learning. They then discuss general methodologies for predictive analytics involving network topology and dynamics, heterogeneous information network analysis, stochastic simulation, and topic modeling using the abovementioned text corpora. They continue by describing applications such as predicting "who will follow whom?" in a social network, making entity-to-entity recommendations (person-to-person, business-to-business [B2B], consumer-tobusiness [C2B], or business-to-consumer [B2C]), and analyzing big data (especially transactional data) for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications. Finally, the authors examine a few specific recommender systems and systems for interaction discovery, as part of brief case studies.},

abstract = {As online social network services (SNS) are booming and gaining tremendous popularity, there is a sharply increasing amount of information exchange and interactions among SNS users. Taking this advantage, users in SNS make decisions via collecting and combining information from different sources (i.e. other users). However, there exists a large variance of trustworthiness among SNS populations, which is threatening the quality of the information fusion process. In such circumstances, trust relationships among users in SNS are very important in decision making as well as for the success of many SNS-based applications, e.g. recommender systems and ad targeting. An appropriate trust inference mechanism for trust evaluation is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackle the issue of limited trust information due to link sparsity in social networks. In this work, we model the trust relationship among users in SNS as a 2-dimensional vector, and propose a semiring-based model for trust propagation and fusion as the building block of our trust inference framework. Specifically, in our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are both considered, and opinion conflict resolution is supported by our framework of trust inference.},

In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general col-laborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed PushTrust. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.},

We examined how Christian participants perceived the trustworthiness of Muslim and Christian individuals who did or did not engage in religious costly signaling. Religious costly signaling, operationalized as giving to religious charities (Experiments 1 and 2) or adhering to religious dietary restrictions (Experiment 3), increased self-reported trust, regardless of target religious affiliation. Furthermore, when estimating the likelihood that trustworthy versus untrustworthy targets engaged in costly signaling, participants made systematic judgments that showed that costly signaling is associated with trust for both Muslim and Christian targets (Experiment 4). These results are novel in their suggestion that costly signals of religious commitment can increase trust both within and, crucially, across religious-group lines.},

abstract = {Social trust aware recommender systems have been well studied in recent years. However, most of existing methods focus on the recommendation scenarios where users can provide explicit feedback to items. But in most cases, the feedback is not explicit but implicit. Moreover, most of trust aware methods assume the trust relationships among users are single and homogeneous, whereas trust as a social concept is intrinsically multi-faceted and heterogeneous. Simply exploiting the raw values of trust relations cannot get satisfactory results. Based on the above observations, we propose to learn a trust aware personalized ranking method with multi-faceted trust relations for implicit feedback. Specifically, we first introduce the social trust assumption — a user's taste is close to the neighbors he/she trusts — into the Bayesian Personalized Ranking model. To explore the impact of users' multi-faceted trust relations, we further propose a categorysensitive random walk method CRWR to infer the true trust value on each trust link. Finally, we arrive at our trust strength aware item recommendation method SocialBPRCRWR by replacing the raw binary trust matrix with the derived real-valued trust strength. Data analysis and experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the existence of social trust influence and the effectiveness of our social based ranking method SocialBPRCRWR in terms of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve).},

Additionally, we accounted for the importance of context-sensitive services in m-commerce by examining, whether different usage contexts yield preferences for a certain level of social presence in a recommender system. Our findings suggest that different types of recommender systems vary in their impact on trusting beliefs. Furthermore, the usage of recommender systems is more likely to translate into purchase intentions in high-risk situations. In high-risk situations, low levels of social presence in recommender systems are important whereas in low-risk situations, high levels of social presence are preferred. Limitations and future implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

Undoubtedly these sharing activities make our life more fantastic. However, meanwhile one challenge we have to face is information overload that we do not have enough time to review all of the content broadcasted through OSNs. So we need to have a mechanism to help users recognize interesting items from a large pool of content. In this project, we aim at filtering unwanted content based on the strength of trust relationships between users. We have proposed two kinds of trust models - basic trust model and source-level trust model. The trust values are estimated based on historical user interactions and profile similarity. We estimate dynamic trusts and analyze the evolution of trust relationships over dates. We also incorporate the auxiliary causes of interactions to moderate the noisy effect of user's intrinsic tendency to perform a certain type of interaction. In addition, since the trustworthiness of diverse information sources are rather distinct, we further estimate trust values at source-level. Our recommender systems utilize several types of Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, including conventional CF (namely user-based, item-based, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based), and also trust-combined user-based CF. We evaluate our trust models and recommender systems on Friendfeed datasets. By comparing the evaluation results, we found that the recommendations based on estimated trust relationships were better than conventional CF recommendations.},

This medium allows legitimate users as well as spammers to publish their content, leveraging the open environment and fewer restrictions associated with OSNs.

Most of the existing trustworthiness evaluation approaches of users and their posts in OSNs are generic-based approaches. There is a lack of domain-based trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms. In OSNs, discovering users' influence in a specific domain has been motivated by its significance in a broad range of applications such as personalized recommendation systems and expertise retrieval. The aim of this paper is to present a preliminary approach to evaluating domain-based user's trustworthiness in OSNs. We provide a novel distinguishing measurement for users in a set of knowledge domains. Domains are extracted from the user's content using semantic analysis. In order to obtain the level of trustworthiness, a metric incorporating a number of attributes extracted from content analysis and user analysis is consolidated and formulated considering temporal factor. The approach presented in this paper is promising since it provides a fine-grained trustworthiness analysis of users and their domains of interest in the OSNs.},

In this sense, building accurate profiles plays an essential role in this context making the system's success depend to a large extent on the ability of the learned profiles to represent the user's preferences and needs. An ontology works very well to characterize the users profiles involved in the process of generating recommendations.

abstract = {Signed networks, in which the relationship between two nodes can be either positive (indicating a relationship such as trust) or negative (indicating a relationship such as distrust), are becoming increasingly common. A plausible model for user behavior analytics in signed networks can be based upon the assumption that more extreme positive and negative relationships are explored and exploited before less extreme ones. Such a model implies that a personalized ranking list of latent links should place positive links on the top, negative links at the bottom, and unknown status links in between. Traditional ranking metrics, e.g., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), are however not suitable for quantifying such a ranking list which includes positive, negative, and unknown status links. To address this issue, a generalized AUC (GAUC) which can measure both the head and tail of a ranking list has been introduced. Since GAUC weights each pairwise comparison equally and the calculation of GAUC requires quadratic time, we derive two lower bounds of GAUC which can be computed in linear time and put more emphasis on ranking positive links on the top and negative links at the bottom of a ranking list. Next, we develop two efficient latent link recommendation (ELLR) algorithms in order to recommend links by directly optimizing these two lower bounds, respectively. Finally, we compare these two ELLR algorithms with top-performing baseline methods over four benchmark datasets, among which the largest network has more than 100 thousand nodes and seven million entries. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed ELLR algorithms outperform state-of-the-art approaches for link recommendation in signed networks at no cost in efficiency.},

abstract = {Abstract 'If you go to Ferran Adria's restaurant you will have the time of your life!' 'If you study everyday for two hours you will get very good marks next semester.' These are examples of advice. We say an advice has two components: a plan to perform and a goal to achieve. In dynamic logic, an advice could be formalised as: [P$\eta$]G. That is, if $\eta$ performs plan P, then goal G will necessarily be achieved. An adviser is an entity which provides such advice. An adviser may be an agent, a planner, or a complex recommender system. This paper proposes a novel trust model for assessing the trustworthiness of advice and advisers. It calculates the expectation of an advice's outcome by assessing the probabilities of the advised plan being picked up and performed, and the goal being achieved. These probabilities are learned from an analysis of similar past experiences using tools such as semantic matching and action empowerment.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) are programs that apply knowledge discovery techniques to make personalized recommendations for user's information on the web. In online sharing communities or e-commerce sites, trust is an important mechanism to improve relationship among users. Trust-aware recommender systems are techniques to make use of trust statements and user personal data in social networks. The accuracy of ratings prediction in RSs is one of the most important problems. In this paper, a Reliability-based Trust-aware Collaborative Filtering (RTCF) method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the trust-aware recommender systems. In the proposed method first of all, the initial trust network of the active user is constructed by using combination of the similarity values and the trust statements. Then, an initial rate is predicted for an unrated item of the user. In the next step, a novel trust based reliability measure is proposed to evaluate the quality of the predicted rate. Then, a new mechanism is performed to reconstruct the trust network for those of the users with lower reliability value than a predefined threshold. Finally, the final rate of the unrated item is predicted based on the new trust network of the user. In other words, the proposed method provides a dynamic mechanism to construct trust network of the users based on the proposed reliability measure. Therefore, the proposed method leads to improve the reliability and also the accuracy of the predictions. Experimental results performed on two real-world datasets including; Epinions and Flixster, demonstrated that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy and also obtained reasonable user and rate coverage compared to several state-of-the-art recommender system methods.},

Trust clearly elevates accuracy of prediction rating for users; especially, when the user's preferences are insufficient, trustworthy friend or people viewpoints can be confidence referenced. However in previous researches, Trust network is reconstructed by removing trust links between users having correlation coefficient below a specified threshold value. On the other hand it does not consider the ratings from friends below a certain trust value. It reduces usefulness data points in recommendation process and therefore raises the accuracy. So determination of the threshold value constitutes one of the main challenges with these approaches. As the performance of proposed methods are highly sensitive to this threshold. In this research, we propose a novel method for recommendation based on fuzzy logic in social networks. In this method the weighted average of all ratings are calculated in the process of recommendation. These weights are determined through a fuzzy method. Finally Epinions dataset is used to demonstrate the performance of proposed method.},

However, on some domains, usable attributes may be difficult to fill in manually and yet accessible from LOD cloud. A pilot study was conducted on the domain of secondhand bookshops. In this domain, recommending is extraordinary difficult because of high ratio between objects and users, lack of significant attributes and limited availability of items. Both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation applicability is questionable under this conditions. We queried both Czech and English language edition of DBPedia in order to receive additional information about objects (books) and used various recommending algorithms to learn user preferences.

abstract = {Recent online services rely heavily on automatic personal-ization to recommend relevant content to a large number of users. This requires systems to scale promptly to accommo-date the stream of new users visiting the online services for the first time. In this work, we propose a content-based rec-ommendation system to address both the recommendation quality and the system scalability. We propose to use a rich feature set to represent users, according to their web brows-ing history and search queries. We use a Deep Learning ap-proach to map users and items to a latent space where the similarity between users and their preferred items is maxi-mized. We extend the model to jointly learn from features of items from different domains and user features by intro-ducing a multi-view Deep Learning model. We show how to make this rich-feature based user representation scalable by reducing the dimension of the inputs and the amount of training data. The rich user feature representation allows the model to learn relevant user behavior patterns and give useful recommendations for users who do not have any in-teraction with the service, given that they have adequate search and browsing history. The combination of different domains into a single model for learning helps improve the recommendation quality across all the domains, as well as having a more compact and a semantically richer user latent feature vector. We experiment with our approach on three real-world recommendation systems acquired from different sources of Microsoft products: Windows Apps recommen-dation, News recommendation, and Movie/TV recommen-dation. Results indicate that our approach is significantly better than the state-of-The-Art algorithms (up to 49% en-hancement on existing users and 115% enhancement on new users). In addition, experiments on a publicly open data set also indicate the superiority of our method in compar-ison with transitional generative topic models, for model-ing cross-domain recommender systems. Scalability analy-sis show that our multi-view DNN model can easily scale to encompass millions of users and billions of item entries. Experimental results also confirm that combining features from all domains produces much better performance than building separate models for each domain.},

The existing context-aware matrix factorization methods only consider the influence of contextual information on rating prediction, which are faced with the sparse initial rating matrix issue. To solve all the problems above, we propose two context-aware trust-based matrix factorization approaches to take both user-based implicit trust network model and item-based implicit trust network model into account and fully capture the influence of both context and trust information on rating.

In this study, we explore two scalable, general-purpose meta-algorithmic approaches - based on bagging and iterative smoothing - that can be used in conjunction with different traditional recommendation algorithms to improve their stability. Our experimental results on real-world rating data demonstrate that both approaches can achieve substantially higher stability as compared to the original recommendation algorithms.

Incorporating trust information into the collaborative filtering systems is an attractive approach to resolve these problems. In this paper, we present a model-based collaborative filtering method by applying a novel graph clustering algorithm and also considering trust statements. In the proposed method first of all, the problem space is represented as a graph and then a sparsest subgraph finding algorithm is applied on the graph to find the initial cluster centers. Then, the proposed graph clustering algorithm is performed to obtain the appropriate users/items clusters.

abstract = {The explosive growth of the World Wide Web leads to the fast advancing development of e-commerce techniques. Recommender systems, which use personalised information filtering techniques to generate a set of items suitable to a given user, have received considerable attention. User- and item-based algorithms are two popular techniques for the design of recommender systems. These two algorithms are known to have Cold-Start problems, i.e., they are unable to effectively handle Cold-Start users who have an extremely limited number of purchase records. In this paper, we develop TrustRank, a novel recommender system which handles the Cold-Start problem by leveraging the user-trust networks which are commonly available for e-commerce applications. A user-trust network is formed by friendships or trust relationships that users specify among them. While it is straightforward to conjecture that a user-trust network is helpful for improving the accuracy of recommendations, a key challenge for using user-trust network to facilitate Cold-Start users is that these users also tend to have a very limited number of trust relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-processing propagation of the Cold-Start users' trust network. In particular, by applying the personalised PageRank algorithm, we expand the friends of a given user to include others with similar purchase records to his/her original friends. To make this propagation algorithm scalable to a large amount of users, as required by real-world recommender systems, we devise an iterative computation algorithm of the original personalised TrustRank which can incrementally compute trust vectors for Cold-Start users. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the consistently improvement provided by our proposed algorithm over the existing recommender algorithms on the accuracy of recommendations for Cold-Start users.},

abstract = {Purpose - e-Commerce recommenders have positive benefits both for consumers and the online stores using them. The focus of research in this topic has mostly been technical (e.g. design, type of recommenders, inputs, or outputs). However, a prior key question is what leads a consumer to use an e-vendor's recommender. The consumer process of adoption and use of such recommenders involves subjective factors which need a psychological approach. This perspective has been neglected so far. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and validate an integrative model which adapts various theories and models - i.e. the original formulation of the technology acceptance model (TAM), the integrated trust-TAM model, and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) - in order to explain such a process. Design/methodology/approach - The field study consisted of a simulated online shopping process undertaken by a valid sample of 300 internet users with a recommender at a real online store (Amazon). Many of the constructs' measurement scales have been adapted from previously validated scales never before applied to this study's context, and the authors have consequently rigorously validated them here too; this also constitutes one of the research's valuable contributions. Detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are applied to assess the empirical validity of the model. Findings - The model's core structure and its relationships are proved to be valid for explaining a consumer's intention to use an e-vendor's recommender In particular, trust and perceived usefulness of the recommender stand out as the determining factors of its use, though the consumer's attitude toward the recommender and others' opinion of its use also have significant influence too. Originality/value - The consumer's psychological angle has been overlooked by previous studies on the adoption and use of online stores' recommendation systems. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first attempt to validate a model aimed at comprehensively approaching the consumer's adoption of an e-vendor's recommender. The findings provide several theoretical contributions and implications for practitioners.},

abstract = {Rapid expansion of the Internet makes competition between many websites and social networks more prevalent. Several users cannot choose their favorite options because of huge amount of information they will face. This causes information overhead problem. Recommender systems with collaborative filtering appeared in different area to solve this problem. In recent years, expansion of e-commerce websites and social networks gives form to credit mechanism which can be used to improve performance of collaborative filtering system and to eliminate their limitations. Most models of credit are based on scores which users give to items and also relation credits and popularity. In this model, if users scoring to items is little it will cause data dispersion. In this paper, different types of trust models in recommender systems will be studied. Also these systems are classified into synthetic and non-synthetic types. Among modern methods are hybrid personal trustandhybrid personal and grouptrust. Finally, all models are compared with each other and their advantages and disadvantages are clarified. Comparing with different methods shows that the final trust method has a higher recommendation quality than other collaborative filteringmethods. It also increases accuracy of prediction superbly.},

Dentistry has also been impacted by dental patients' reviews. This paper classifies trust-related information for dental care recommendations onto 4 categories: context, relationship, reputation and subjective criteria. It discusses each category and describes how they help focussing on trust when matching patients and dentists in brief. The paper then focuses on subjective criteria and presents the results of a survey aimed at showing trustrelated information emerged from subjective characteristics. Traits of personalities are used as subjective characteristics of patients and that of dentists are derived from the online patients' reviews. 580 Australian patients were surveyed to determine what factors affect their decision to find the trusted dentist. Subjective characteristics of dentists such as dentists' qualities and experienced dentists are considered the most important factors after location and cost. The most preferred dentists' qualities by almost all types of personalities are experienced, professional and quality of service. When the patients are further classified based on levels of fear, their preferences for dentists' qualities changed. Subjective qualities of both patients and dentists are important factors to improve the matching capability for the dental care recommendation systems.},

Drawing on a multi-method approach, this paper develops a framework for identifying factors influencing the adoption of Open Government Data (OGD) by private organisations. Subsequently the framework was used to analyse five cases. The findings reveal that for private organizations to use OGD, the content and source of the data needs to be clear, a usable open data license must be present and continuity of data updates needs to be ensured. For none of the investigated private organisations OGD was key to their existence. Organisations use OGD in addition to, or as an enhancement of their core activities. As the official OGD-channels are bypassed trustworthy relationships between the data user and data provider were found to play an important role in finding and using OGD. The findings of this study can help government agencies in developing OGD-policies and stimulating OGD-use.},

Despite this, many real-world recommender systems separate profile updates and feedback, obfuscating the relationship between them. This paper studies the effects of what we call hypothetical recommendations. These are recommendations generated by lowcost, exploratory profile manipulations, or "what-if" scenarios. In particular, we evaluate the effects of dynamic feedback from the recommender system on profile manipulations, the resulting recommendations and the user's overall experience. Results from a user experiment (N=129) suggest that (i) dynamic feedback improves the effectiveness of profile updates, (ii) when dynamic feedback is present, users can identify and remove items that contribute to poor recommendations, (iii) profile update tasks improve perceived accuracy of recommendations and trust in the recommender, regardless of actual recommendation accuracy.},

abstract = {With the prosperity of e-commerce, on-line vendors use recommendation systems in different fields. Classic recommendation algorithms are designed assuming that data is stationary and will not change over time. However, since the scale and variability of data are growing gradually, these methods will encounter the issues of the memory deficient and the out-of-date model, which degrade the recommendation accuracy intensively. In addition, retraining the whole model for every new arrival record results in high complexity. In this paper we propose a light-weight adaptive updating method to overcome these issues. Comparing with the explicit feedback recommendation, which asks the customers to express their opinions on the recommended items, the implicit feedback recommendation is easier to collect and non- intrusive way. However, the dynamic time-variant system with implicit feedback has not been seen in the literature. In this paper, we propose a real- time incremental updating algorithm (RI-SGD) to deal with time-variant systems based on the implicit feedback. We compare our method with methods that retraining the whole model and show that our method costs less than 1% of the retraining time with a competitive accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the quality of a recommender system implemented in a simulation to assist with choosing a diversionary airport for distressed aircraft. In the third of the series of studies investigating the feasibility of ground-supported single pilot operations (SPO) a recommender system was used by 35 airline pilots as an aid for selecting diversionary airports. These pilots, acting as ground operators, used the recommender system from a ground station when off-nominal events required them to provide ground support to a single piloted aircraft. The unique circumstances imposed by each of the scenarios required the ground operators, together with the recommender system, to consider the relative importance of different factors when recommending an airport. Post-trial questionnaires were used to evaluate the recommender system. Results indicated that the pilots did not find the recommender system very transparent and did not always trust its initial recommendation. However, pilots did appear to find the recommender system to be effective in supporting them with the high workload in off nominal situations, and interactions with the system appear to have been satisfactory. Pilots also reported in post simulation surveys a desire to have better explanations for those recommendations. Findings will inform the development of future iterations of the recommender system, as well as influence SPO procedures and further development of a prototype ground station.},

abstract = {Random s-intersection graphs have recently received much interest in a wide range of application areas. Broadly speaking, a random s-intersection graph is constructed by first assigning each vertex a set of items in some random manner, and then putting an undirected edge between all pairs of vertices that share at least s items (the graph is called a random intersection graph when s = 1). A special case of particular interest is a uniform random s-intersection graph, where each vertex independently selects the same number of items uniformly at random from a common item pool. Another important case is a binomial random s-intersection graph, where each item from a pool is independently assigned to each vertex with the same probability. Both models have found numerous applications thus far including cryptanalysis, and modeling recommender systems, secure sensor networks, online social networks, trust networks and small-world networks (uniform random s-intersection graphs), as well as clustering analysis, classification, and the design of integrated circuits (binomial random s-intersection graphs). In this paper, for binomial/uniform random s-intersection graphs, we present results related to k-connectivity and minimum vertex degree. Specifically, we derive the asymptotically exact probabilities and zero-one laws for the following three properties: (i) k-vertex-connectivity, (ii) k-edge-connectivity and (iii) the property of minimum vertex degree being at least k.},

Despite its advances in term of efficiency, easy implementation and robustness, traditional collaborative filtering techniques suffer from several challenges such as cold-start and data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, external information is expected to help improve the overall effectiveness. Among the diverse context information, trust relationships is a widely utilised mechanism. Meanwhile, researchers also found distrust relationships is unavoidable in social network and recommender systems can benefit from distrust information. However, most existed distrusted oriented methods do not take the property of multi-facets in distrust relationships into consideration. In this paper, we exploit distrust relationships in a multi-faceted perspective and proposed a matrix factorization based model with integration of different distrust relationship of quality user between different people. Experimental study on well-known dataset has shown promising result and it is expected that this work could provide insight for researchers in this domain to further discuss the distrust in recommender systems.},

Often a sequence of search requests is necessary to answer the user's information needs, whenever knowledge has to be accumulated first to determine the next search query. On the other hand, retrieval systems for traditional archives face the problem that there is possibly not always a result for an arbitrary search query, simply because of the limited number of documents available. Semantic search systems (try to) determine the meaning of the content of the archived documents first and thus in principle are able to overcome problems of traditional keyword-based search engines concerning the processing of natural language. Moreover, content-based relationships among the documents can be used to filter, navigate, and explore the archive.

abstract = {Recommender systems are one of the “hottest” areas for companies that offer items to end users and have a wide scope of applications, from commercial, through entertainment to educational. Most recommender systems are based on implicit or explicit models of user behaviour, including user ratings, click streams or navigation paths, or complex knowledge structures derived through reasoning from user input data. They deploy various personalization algorithms to adapt the recommendation to the user's interest and context. The current recommendation algorithms have advanced to a stage where they offer very high accuracy in predicting which items the user will like. However, the resulting recommendations are not always accepted well by the users. Sometimes users prefer not to share their data with the system because of privacy concerns, or do not trust the system's recommendations, especially if they do not understand how they were generated. To gain the user's trust, it is important to explain the main principles or mechanism that the recommender system uses; however an explanation would increase the cognitive load of the user and therefore would not be welcome. A visualization of the mechanism or its main principles may be helpful here, since “a picture is worth a thousand words” and it can save users' time and efforts by showing an intuitive and understandable representation of the recommendation mechanism. This talk will give an overview of some of the existing approaches (both from the speaker's own research lab and from other authors) for visualizing recommendation mechanisms and eventually allowing users to control these mechanisms. Starting with work from the area of open / scrutable learner models in the area of intelligent tutoring systems, through approaches for explaining recommendations to approaches visualizing aspects of collaborative, hybrid and social recommenders, the talk will focus on approaches for visualizing social recommendation in streams of social sites updates.},

In this paper, we presented our study on understanding Chinese users' information revelation attitudes and practices which has not been fully explored in both the recommendation and online privacy research fields. Specifically, unlike the majority of previous studies that revealed users' self-disclosure practices and attitudes in SNSs, our study is the first and only an initial investigation into the two aspects of the personal information disclosure and sharing: the differences of personal information shared by and with different types of audiences. Our study revealed that among the five types of recipient's, students placed the least trust on Advertisers, among four other groups as Close Friends and Family, University Community, Friends on the Social Networking Sites, and Complete (online) Strangers. Overall, students feel more comfortable actively sharing personal information with the types of audiences than being shared by these audiences of their personal details.},

Some existing reputation systems and trust-based security systems use the flawed notion of endogenous discounting. Endogenous discounting is the idea that claims deviating from prior expectations should be ignored or discounted, which introduces confirmation bias. To show the fallacy of endogenous discounting, we construct a semantic meta-model that captures the key notions surrounding recommendations. We prove that any model covered by the meta-model can be formulated in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We show how divide-and-conquer clashes with endogenous discounting. Lastly, we discuss the implications on existing work that applies endogenous discounting, and provide suggestions for future work.},

abstract = {Many trust-aware recommender systems (TARSs) have explored the value of explicit trust which is specified by users with binary values. But existing works of TARSs suffer from the problem of the lack of explicit trust which may not always be available in online social networks. In order to solve this issue, some implicit trust based TARSs are proposed. However, these methods generally predict implicit trust scores between users based on the interpersonal aspect, i.e., propagated trust, similarity obtained by user ratings on co-rated items, while ignore the personal aspects, i.e., trust bias and the impersonal aspects, i.e., local-topology-based features in trust networks, which are also important for implicit trust prediction. In this paper, we attempt to propose a classification approach to address the trust/distrust prediction problem. First, we obtain an extensive set of relevant features derived from the personal aspects, interpersonal aspects and impersonal aspects of trust. Then a logistic regression model is developed and trained by accommodating these factors, and applied to predict continuous values of users' trust and distrust. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted implicit trust. The experimental results on realworld data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in employing implicit trust/distrust into existing trust-aware recommendation approaches.},

abstract = {Recommender systems assist users in making choices from various alternatives for estimating user preferences through rating predictions. Several existing recommender algorithms combine collaborative filtering and social trust from social networks together in order to overcome their limitations such as cold start, data sparsity, and privacy attacks. Many trust based recommendation approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users based on a single aspect of trust. However, in social science, trust is known as a complex term with multiple facets, which has not considered in prior trust based recommender systems. This paper explores this issue by enhancing the social trust framework with four interpersonal aspects of trust (benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability) which are computationally modeled based on users' historic ratings. For accommodating these aspects, the matrix factorization model is developed and trained, and then users' trust and distrust continues values predicted. The trust values are further refined by distrust values. Experimental results on datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Recommender systems research has experienced different stages such as from user preference understanding to content analysis. Typical recommendation algorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are IID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on specific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex recommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor heterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective coupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as intrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID complexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective couplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a novel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID coupling relations between users and items. Such couplings integrate the intra-coupled interactions within an attribute and intercoupled interactions among different attributes. Experimental results on two open data sets demonstrate that the user/item couplings can be effectively applied in RS and CMF outperforms the benchmark methods.},

abstract = {In a trust network, two users connected by a trust relationship are assumed to have similar interests. Based on this assumption, existing trust-based recommendation methods predict ratings for a target user on unseen items by utilizing available ratings information of those users who are "similar" to the target user in the trust network. Here, the concept of similarity is defined as the reachability via the trust relationship in the network. In the process, however, these methods usually follow the trustor-trustee relationship only in the forward direction, i.e., from trustor to trustee, but not in the backward direction. That is, they have overlooked the possibility of utilizing the ratings information obtainable from those users reachable in the backward direction who, we believe, are also deemed to have similar interests to the target user. In this paper, we investigate this possibility of identifying and adding these users to the trustable user group when predicting ratings by collaborative filtering. Experiments show that our approach can improve the coverage of prediction while preserving the accuracy.},

abstract = {Many trust-aware recommender systems have explored the value of explicit trust, which is specified by users with binary values and simply treated as a concept with a single aspect. However, in social science, trust is known as a complex term with multiple facets, which has not been well exploited in prior recommender systems. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a (dis)trust framework with considerations of both interpersonal and impersonal aspects of trust and distrust. Specifically, four interpersonal aspects (benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability) are computationally modeled based on users' historic ratings, while impersonal aspects are formulated from the perspective of user connections in trust networks. Two logistic regression models are developed and trained by accommodating these factors, and then applied to predict continuous values of users' trust and distrust, respectively. Trust information is further refined by corresponding predicted distrust information. The experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in further improving the performance of existing state-of-the-art trust-aware recommendation approaches.},

However, browsing through a large and unstructured list of categories in order to select the most fitting one might be time consuming for the end users. In this paper, we present an approach for recommending categories for geospatial entities, based on previously annotated entities.

These features involve spatial and textual properties of the entities. We evaluate two different approaches (SVM and kNN) on several combinations of the defined training features and we demonstrate that the best algorithm (SVM) can provide recommendations with high precision, utilizing the defined features.

abstract = {In Service-Oriented Computing environments, there is a large number of service providers providing a variety of services to service customers. Conventional recommender systems, which adopt the information filtering techniques, can be used to automatically generate recommendations of service providers to service customers who are also the system users. However, data sparsity and trust enhancement are the traditional problems in recommender systems. Targeting the data sparsity problem, recent studies on recommender systems have started to leverage information from online social networks to collect recommendations from more participants and derive the final recommendation. However, this requires the methods to infer the trust between participants without any direct interactions in online social networks, which should take into account both the social context of participants and the context of the target services to be recommended, for trust enhanced recommendations. In this paper, we first present a contextual social network model that takes into account both participants' personal characteristics (referred to as the independent social context, including preference and expertise in domains) and mutual relations (referred to as the dependent social context, including the trust, social intimacy, and interaction context between two participants). In addition, we propose a new probabilistic approach, SocialTrust, as the first solution in the literature, to social context-aware trust inference in social networks. The result delivered by this approach is particularly important in evaluating the trust from a source participant to an end recommender who recommends a target service or service provider, via the sub-network consisting of intermediate participants/recommenders between them and relevant contextual information. Moreover, we propose algorithms that consider cycles and information updates in social networks. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective and superior to existing trust inference methods, and can deliver more reasonable and trustworthy results. The proposed algorithms considering cycles and information updates in social networks are efficient and applicable to real social networks.},

abstract = {Predicting human activities is important for improving recommender systems or analyzing social relationships among users. Those human activities are usually represented as multi-object relationships (e.g. user's tagging activities for items or user's tweeting activities at some locations). Since multi-object relationships are naturally represented as a tensor, tensor factorization is becoming more important for predicting users' possible activities. However, its prediction accuracy is weak for ambiguous and/or sparsely observed objects. Our solution, Semantic data Representation for Tensor Factorization (SRTF), tackles these problems by incorporating semantics into tensor factorization based on the following ideas: (1) It first links objects to vocabularies/taxonomies and resolves the ambiguity caused by objects that can be used for multiple purposes. (2) It then links objects to composite classes that merge classes in different kinds of vocabularies/taxonomies (e.g. classes in vocabularies for movie genres and those for directors) to avoid low prediction accuracy caused by rough-grained semantics. (3) It finally lifts sparsely observed objects into their classes to solve the sparsity problem for rarely observed objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that leverages semantics to inject expert knowledge into tensor factorization. Experiments show that SRTF achieves up to 10% higher accuracy (lower RMSE value) than state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite of service QoS, the use of user feedback is becoming the current trend in service recommendation. Likewise in traditional recommender systems, sparsity, cold-start and trustworthiness are major issues challenging service recommendation in adopting similarity-based approaches. Meanwhile, with the prevalence of social networks, nowadays people become active in interacting with various computers and users, resulting in a huge volume of data available, such as service information, user-service ratings, interaction logs, and user relationships. Therefore, how to incorporate the trust relationship in social networks with user feedback for service recommendation motivates this work. In this paper, we propose a social network-based service recommendation method with trust enhancement known as RelevantTrustWalker. First, a matrix factorization method is utilized to assess the degree of trust between users in social network. Next, an extended random walk algorithm is proposed to obtain recommendation results. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, experiments on a real-world dataset are conducted and experimental results indicate that the quality of the recommendation and the speed of the method are improved compared with existing algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Although recommender systems are extremely useful when it comes to recommending new products to users, it is important that these applications explain their recommendations so that users can consider and trust them. There is also another reason: by analyzing why the system recommends a particular item or proposes a certain rating, the user might also consider the quality of the recommendation and, if appropriate, change its predicted value. On this basis, this paper presents a new technique to improve recommendations based on a series of explanations that should be given when various already-known items are recommended. To summarize, the aim of our proposal is to learn a regression model from the information presented in these explanations and, where appropriate, use this model to change the recommendation for a target item. In order to test this approach, we experimented with the MovieLens data set. A number of lessons can be learned: firstly, it is possible to learn from a set of explanations, although this is highly user-dependent; and secondly, we can use an automatic procedure to analyze the role of the different features presented in an explanation. We consider these results to be interesting and to validate our novel approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, considering both the trust and distrust relationships, a SVD signs based community mining method is proposed to process the trust relationship matrix in order to discover the trust communities. A modified trust metric which considers a given user's expertise level in a community is presented to obtain the indirect trust values between users. Then some missing ratings of the given user are complemented by the weighted average preference of his/her trusted neighbors selected in the same community during the random walk procedures.

However, it suffers from several inherent deficiencies such as data sparsity and cold start. To better show user preferences for the cold users additional information (e.g., trust) is often applied. We describe the stages based on which the ratings of an active user's trusted neighbors are incorporated to complement and represent the preferences of the active user. First, by discriminating between different users, we calculate the significance of each user to make recommendations. Then the trusted neighbors of the active user are identified and aggregated. Hence, a new rating profile can be formed to represent the preferences of the active user. In the next stage, similar users probed based on the new rating profile. Finally, recommendations are generated in the same way as the conventional CF with the difference that if a similar neighbor had not rated the target item, we will predict the value of the target item for this similar neighbor by using the ratings of her directly trusted neighbors and applying MoleTrust algorithm, so as to incorporate more similar users to generate prediction for this target item.

abstract = {With the advent of online social networks, recommender systems have became crucial for the success of many online applications/services due to their significance role in tailoring these applications to user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasing popularity, in general, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trust information in the recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user communities, in addition to trust relations, distrust relations also exist between users. For instance, in Epinions, the concepts of personal "web of trust" and personal "block list" allow users to categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. Hence, it will be interesting to incorporate this new source of information in recommendation as well. In contrast to the incorporation of trust information in recommendation which is thriving, the potential of explicitly incorporating distrust relations is almost unexplored. In this article, we propose a matrix factorization-based model for recommendation in social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions dataset, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard trust-enhanced or distrustenhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine an advanced collaborative filtering method that uses similarity transitivity concepts. By propagating 'similarity' between users, in a similar way as with 'trust', we can significantly expand the space of potential recommenders and system's coverage, improving also the recommendations' accuracy. While 'trust' information might be missing or be misleading and incorrect, 'similarity' between two users can be directly calculated using the information from users' item ratings. A recent study observed a strong correlation between trust and preference similarity in online rating systems, therefore it makes sense that transitivity concepts can also be applied to 'similarity', much as they are applied to 'trust'. In contrast to a vast amount of work that seeks to exploit existed social information, like trust, from social networks to improve the recommendation process, we propose the other way round towards the same goal: use similarity transitivity concepts exploiting the rating history of the recommender system's users to lead to the formation of new relationships and even social communities that were not previously existed. We propose a novel similarity propagation scheme to confront the data sparsity problem in recommender systems and evaluate our method over two datasets with different characteristics, exhibiting a much higher recommendation coverage and better accuracy than classical collaborative filtering methods even under very sparse data conditions.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most successful technology for recommender systems. The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

In this paper, we find the phenomenon that users in the contexts of recommendation system and social network do not share the same interest space. Based on this finding, we proposed the social regulatory factor regression model (SRFRM) which could connect different interest spaces in different contexts together in an unified latent factor model. Specifically, different from the traditional social based latent factor models with strong limitation that all sides share the same feature space, the proposed method leverages the regulatory factor number on both sides to meet the fact that users and items or users in different contexts may not share the same interest space. It works by incorporating two linear transformation matrices into the matrix co-factorization framework that matrix factorization of user ratings is regularized by that of social trust network. We study a large subsets of data from epinions.com and douban.com respectively. The experimental results indicate that users in different contexts have different interest spaces and our model achieves a higher performance compared with related state-of-the-art methods.},

This information can be exploited for creating better recommendations but also for optimizing the execution of existing algorithms in large scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a scalable model for generating personalized user recommendations, which first uses the social information and divides the social graph into subgraphs and then applies Collaborative Filtering on the preferences information related to each subgraph. The results of our experiments show that our proposed model can perform faster than the traditional techniques while producing high level personalized recommendations.

abstract = {Multi-matrix factorization models provide a scalable and effective approach for multi-relational learning tasks such as link prediction, Linked Open Data (LOD) mining, recommender systems and social network analysis. Such models are learned by optimizing the sum of the losses on all relations in the data. Early models address the problem where there is only one target relation for which predictions should be made. More recent models address the multi-target variant of the problem and use the same set of parameters to make predictions for all target relations. In this paper, we argue that a model optimized for each target relation individually has better predictive performance than models optimized for a compromise on the performance on all target relations. We introduce specific parameters for each target but, instead of learning them independently from each other, we couple them through a set of shared auxiliary parameters, which has a regularizing effect on the target specific ones. Experiments on large Web datasets derived from DBpedia, Wikipedia and BlogCatalog show the performance improvement obtained by using target specific parameters and that our approach outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods while being able to scale gracefully to big data.},

Moreover, the authors infer explicit and implicit social circles to enhance the performance of recommendation diversity.

And, second, we propose to incorporate these trust scores inferred from the candidate TMs into social matrix factorization (MF). We investigate if incorporating the implicit trust scores in MF can make rating prediction as accurate as the MF on explicit trust scores.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual architecture which uses the social trust consensus from users to improve the accuracy of the trust-based recommender systems. It is based on an existent model and integrates user's trust relations and item's factors into a generic latent factor model. One advantage of our model is the possibility to bias the users' similarity computation according to a trust consensus that assists in the formation of groups, such as the group of individuals who share the same content. The proposal represents the first steps towards the development of a group recommender system model.

The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set. The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model.},

To facilitate the discovery, matchmaking and networking among the co-workers across the enterprises social recommendation systems are often used. Off-the-shelf nature of these components often makes it hard for individuals to control their exposure as well as their preferences of whom to connect to. To this end, trust based recommenders have been amongst the most popular and demanding solutions due to their advantage of using social trust to generate more accurate suggestions for peers to connect to. They also allow individuals to control their exposure based on explicit trust levels. In this work we have proposed for an enterprise trust-based recommendation system with privacy controls. To generate accurate predictions, a local trust metric is defined between users based on correlations of user's profiled content such as blogging, articles wrote, comments, and likes along with profile information such as organization, region, interests or skills. Privacy metric is defined in such a way that users have full freedom either to hide their data from the recommender or customize their profiles to make them visible only to users with defined level of trustworthy.},

It is based on the scale-freeness of the trust network: a skeleton, which consists of hub nodes of the trust network, is involved in trust propagations. Trusts are first propagated from active users to the skeleton, and then recommenders are searched via the skeleton. One fundamental research issue in S-Searching is to search the skeleton for active users efficiently. Existing methods fully search the trust network to find hub nodes in the skeleton for active users. It has high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative deepening-based skeleton searching strategy for S-Searching, in which a depth-limited search is run repeatedly. The depth limit is increased with each iteration until it reaches the maximum allowable trust propagation distance.

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) use the opinions of members of a community to help individuals in that community identify the information most likely to be interesting to them or relevant to their needs. These systems use the similarity between the users and recommenders or between the items to form recommendation list for the user. We believe that, various interactions and arguments exchanged in favor or against are responsible for the eventual result of a recommendation process. Therefore, besides recommendations it is vital to determine the users' response on such interactions to determine more accurate trust estimates for users in the system. Hence, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy and argumentation based trust model which is also integrated within the practical reasoning of agents in the multi-agent recommender systems. This integration allows the agent to take trustworthy decisions and reason about them as well. The user is also able to make a wiser selection in case there are conflicting opinions related to a specific product or the user comes across a new, unseen product and is indecisive about it. As a result it improves recommender's persuasive power and user's trust in the system resulting in an increase in the user's acceptance of the recommendations. The experiments performed with a Book Recommender System (using a hybrid recommendation approach), confirms that the variant implemented with the proposed approach performs better than those using conventional methods. Results obtained from evaluation metrics showed that the recommendations were more accurate, relevant and novel. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Providing high quality recommendations is important for e-commerce systems to assist users in making effective selection decisions from a plethora of choices. Collaborative filtering is a widely accepted technique to generate recommendations based on the ratings of like-minded users. However, it suffers from several inherent issues such as data sparsity and cold start. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called "Merge" to incorporate social trust information (i.e., trusted neighbors explicitly specified by users) in providing recommendations. Specifically, ratings of a user's trusted neighbors are merged to complement and represent the preferences of the user and to find other users with similar preferences (i.e., similar users). In addition, the quality of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings and the ratio of conflicts between positive and negative opinions. Further, the rating confidence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for a given item is generated by aggregating the ratings of similar users. Experimental results based on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms other counterparts both in terms of accuracy and coverage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

If one plans to build a support service that provides insight into the value of future cooperation, one first needs to know what contributes to effective and efficient cooperation. In addition to carrying out a literature review, we invoked the eDelphi method to answer this question. eDelphi is a method to solicit knowledge from experts anonymously and without geographical constraints. Observations from two eDelphi rounds are reported in this article. The first round focused on factor generation and determined which factors influence cooperation networks; it was conducted with two groups of six representative experts. Experts list open communication, a positive attitude, trust, keeping appointments, and personality as influential factors for cooperation networks. A team of four moderators categorised the factors in a second round, resulting in four core clusters: personal characteristics, diversity, effective cooperation, and managerial aspects. Interestingly the experts failed to list some factors that are mentioned in the literature. This finding is discussed.},

In this chapter we take the point of view of predicting the Trust value on the basis of the reputation information that the agent may collect.

An effective model for indirect trust computation is proposed which is capable of identifying dishonest recommendations.

In addition, users could specify their preferences of social contexts including social relationships and social trust between participants and social positions of participants in path selection.

The OMS as tool for common association supports the ability for people to form self-organizing groups following the notion of the data commons put forward by Elinor Ostrom [2]. The data commons in OMS consists of various personal data which the owner has agreed to contribute into what Ostrom calls the common-pool resource, and which is to be managed by the self-organized group or institution. This paper discusses some design considerations of the OMS platform from the perspective of the privacy and security of the personal data that participate in the common-pool resource.

abstract = {Internet has grown exponentially over the years; it hasunder its ambit, enormous amount of information and data in almost all domains and subjects, and is ever expanding. This unprecedented expansion has created problems for the users to retrieve useful information from internet and ignore the useless ones.Recommender systems are meant to be an important solution to the data overload problem that persists today in World Wide Web and is meant to be an important tool that aids the user in filtering the relevant useful information and weed out the unnecessary part. Very recent research trend in Recommender systemsencourages towards consideration of Context awareness.One of the major challenges in the context aware recommender system is the determination of proper granularity for relevant contexts so that the accuracy of the recommender system improves. If the context granularity is very small, that is the context parameters are too granular, the data points matching the contexts reduces. Context granularity is too large; contexts become generic and the level of context matching reduces. In both the cases, the overall accuracy of the recommender system suffers and in-turn negatively affects the usability of the recommender system. Contexts in recommender system comprised of „n‟ contextual attributes and the domain of each contextual attribute forms an ordered hierarchy of level of abstraction. It is advantageous if the contexts attributes are hierarchically divided into finer granularity and calculate the similarity between the target contexts with the nearest context attribute. In this paper, we propose an approach and a model,thatcalculatesthe similarities for the context attributes of relevant contexts. If the similarity values are within a predefined range then those are used in trust calculations and neighbourhood formation. This approach is advantageous in terms of increased recommender accuracy and also overcome data sparseness of hard context filtering methods.},

User feedback, both explicit and implicit, has proven to be vital for recommendation systems, with the similarity between users then able to be computed. In this paper we propose that traditional reliance on user similarity may be overstated. Nevertheless, there are many problems to be faced, specifically; sparseness, cold start, prediction accuracy, as well as scalability, which can all, result in a challenge of trust over the recommendation systems. A sparsity rate of 95% has been experienced in CF-based commercial recommendation applications. We discuss the manner in which other factors have a vital role in managing recommendations.

To solve these challenges, the objective item attributes are incorporated as complementary information. However, most of the existing methods for inferring the relationships between items assume that the attributes are “independently and identically distributed (iid)”, which does not always hold in reality. In fact, the attributes are more or less coupled with each other by some implicit relationships. Therefore, in this paper we propose an attribute-based coupled similarity measure to capture the implicit relationships between items. We then integrate the implicit item coupling into MF to form the Coupled Item-based Matrix Factorization (CIMF) model. Experimental results on two open data sets demonstrate that CIMF outperforms the benchmark methods.},

abstract = {Automated recommender systems have played a more and more important role in marketing and ever increasingly booming e-commerce systems. They provide useful predictions personalized recommendations according to customers characteristics and a variety of large and complex product offerings. In many of these recommendation technologies Collaborative Filtering (CF) has proven to be one of the most successful recommendation method, which has been widely used in many e-commerce systems. The success of CF recommendation depends mainly on locating similar neighbors to get recommendation items. However, many scholars have found that the process of finding similar neighbors often fail, due to some inherent weaknesses of CF based recommendation. In view of this, we propose a trust feedback recommendation algorithm based on directed trust graph (DTG), which is able to propagate trust relationship. In our approach, there is no need to compute similarity between users, but utilize the trust relation between them to conduct prediction calculation. Based on the analysis of human trust perception, we incorporate the process into our recommendation algorithm. Experimental evaluation on real life Epinions datasets shows that the effectiveness and practicability of our approach.},

The major contribution of this paper is that it designs a complete model consisting of various visualization styles, whereby each style is used for a specific purpose only. The explanation interface designed is for a hybrid recommender system where the explanation interface of individual recommender is reused in a form that describes it best. In this model the user is held at an important position and using the explanations can incorporate diversity in the recommendations provided by the system.

abstract = {Internet has undergone many fold expansion in last couple of decades or so, the pitfall of that is the data overloading problem which has become extremely intricate for retrieving useful information from internet. Users searching for intended contents have endless number of Web pages to navigate and require enormous efforts, requires judgmental aptitude and intuitiveness to extract meaningful information from almost unlimited number of pages and huge content. Recommender systems are meant to be an important solution to the data overload and skewed information problem that persists today in World Wide Web. Very recent research trend in Recommender systems encourages towards consideration of Context awareness along with trust based filtering.One of the major challenges in the context aware recommender system is the selection of relevant contexts and appropriately weighting the relevant contexts for prediction calculations. Also dynamic nature of trust puts practical challenges in using trust based recommender system. The selection of a few most relevant contexts and using them with proper importance factors incorporates aspects of dynamic behaviour of trust and are vital for enhanced accuracy in the recommender output, as irrelevant and inappropriate contexts assimilation decreases the accuracy of recommender output, creates data sparseness and also increases the computational complexity. There are various ways to infuse the weightages of relevant contexts in recommender systems. While doing the neighbourhood formation, trust propagation and predictions, context weighting plays a pivotal role towards increasing the accuracy of Recommender Systems. In this paper, we propose an approach that incorporates the relative weightages of relevant contexts in trust calculations and neighbourhood formation. Trust network thus formed is leveraged by the context attributes. This approach is advantageous in terms of increased recommender accuracy and also overcome data sparseness of hard context filtering methods.},

Linked Open Data allows recommendations beyond the content domain and supports the detection of new information. One research area with a strong need for the discovery of new information is biodiversity. Due to their heterogeneity, the exploration of biodiversity data requires interdisciplinary collaboration.

abstract = {Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of},

Most recent research has focused on examining the added value of adding semantic features based on structured web data, in particular Linked Open Data (LOD). In this paper, we focus in contrast on semantic feature construction from text, by incorporating features based on semantic frames into a book recommendation classifier. To this purpose we leverage the semantic frames based on parsing the plots of the items under consideration with a state-of-theart semantic parser. By investigating this type of semantic information, we show that these frames are also able to represent information about a particular book, but without the need of having explicitly structured data describing the books available. We reveal that exploiting frame information outperforms a basic bag-of-words approach and that especially the words relating to those frames are beneficial for classification. In a final step we compare and combine our system with the LOD features from a system leveraging DBpedia as knowledge resource. We show that both approaches yield similar results and reveal that combining semantic information from these two different sources might even be beneficial.

abstract = {In many recommendation applications such as news recommendation, the items that can be recommended come and go at a very fast pace. This is a challenge for recommender systems (RS) to face this setting. Online learning algorithms seem to be the most straight forward solution. The contextual bandit framework was introduced for that very purpose. In general the evaluation of a RS is a critical issue. Live evaluation is often avoided due to the potential loss of revenue, hence the need for offline evaluation methods. Two options are available. Model based methods are biased by nature and are thus difficult to trust when used alone. Data driven methods are therefore what we consider here. Evaluating online learning algorithms with past data is not simple but some methods exist in the literature. Nonetheless their accuracy is not satisfactory mainly due to their mechanism of data rejection that only allow the exploitation of a small fraction of the data. We precisely address this issue in this paper. After highlighting the limitations of the previous methods, we present a new method, based on bootstrapping techniques. This new method comes with two important improvements: it is much more accurate and it provides a measure of quality of its estimation. The latter is a highly desirable property in order to minimize the risks entailed by putting online a RS for the first time. We provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as an analysis of the convergence of the measure of quality.},

Most users choose the lookup service, and millions of web logs have been recorded. Although, users expect to submit more expressive queries than keyword lookup, the complexity of SPARQL undoubtedly scared users away. This paper proposes a method of SPARQL query recommendation for exploring RDF repositories. By analyzing web logs of the lookup service, our method extracts the user access patterns, which will be used to recommend SPARQL queries. We implement our method based on Zhishi.me, a Chinese RDF repository with about 150 million triples as well as over one-year web logs.

In our work, we focus on the use of visualization techniques to support exploration of multiple relevance prospects - such as relationships between different recommendation methods, socially connected users and tags. More specifically, we researched how users explore relationships between such multiple relevance prospects with two set-based visualization techniques: a clustermap and a Venn diagram. A comparative analysis of user studies with these two approaches indicates that, although effectiveness of recommendations increases with the use of a clustermap, the approach is too complex for a non-technical audience. A Venn diagram representation is more intuitive and users are more likely to explore relationships that help them find relevant items.},

Though, collaborative filtering is one of the most promising techniques, it still suffers from the cold start problem due to which it is unable to give recommendations to new users. It is also vulnerable to many attacks like shilling attack, grey sheep, etc. which severely hamper the recommendation systems. A trust-based approach combining trust and swarm intelligence (ant colony) with collaborative filtering has been proposed. It also uses item-based predictions in the process of generating recommendations. Ant Colony exhibit self organizing and distributed properties due to which it is used in real time and constantly changing environment. Trust is updated continuously using pheromone updating strategy of ant colony thus, making the system more accurate. By combining these approaches, effective system is proposed which provide solutions to the above mentioned problems of collaborative filtering and predict whether the user will like the certain item or not.

Due to the recent proliferation of rec-ommendation systems, it is tempting to apply these recommenders for selecting software services needed to create a dis-tributed application. As there are subtle differences (e.g., time sensitive features and periodic updates in the case of software services) between physical products and software services, care must be taken in applying any prevalent recommendation techniques to the domain of software services. Hence, this paper suggests an approach towards answering two critical questions - "are the prevalent product-based recommendation techniques suitable for recommending software services or not?" and "are the trust-based recommendations more suita-ble for online software services than the product-based recommendation techniques"? These two questions are addressed in the context of a software marketplace and the preliminary results are discussed in this paper. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {We present a QoS-aware recommender approach based on probabilistic models to assist the selection of web services in open, distributed, and service-oriented environments. This approach allows consumers to maintain a trust model for each service provider they interact with, leading to the prediction of the most trustworthy service a consumer can interact with among a plethora of similar services. In this paper, we associate the trust in a service to its performance denoted by QoS ratings instigated by the amalgamation of various QoS metrics. Since the quality of a service is contingent, which renders its trustworthiness uncertain, we adopt a probabilistic approach for the prediction of the quality of a service based on the evaluation of past experiences (ratings) of each of its consumers. We represent the QoS ratings of services using different statistical distributions, namely multinomial Dirichlet, multinomial generalized Dirichlet, and multinomial Beta-Liouville. We leverage various machine learning techniques to compute the probabilities of each web service to belong to different quality classes. For instance, we use the Bayesian inference method to estimate the parameters of the aforementioned distributions, which presents a multidimensional probabilistic embodiment of the quality of the corresponding web services. We also employ a Bayesian network classifier with a Beta-Liouville prior to enable the classification of the QoS of composite services given the QoS of its constituents. We extend our approach to function in an online setting using the Voting EM algorithm that enables the estimation of the probabilities of the QoS after each interaction with a web service. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in modeling, classifying and incrementally learning the QoS ratings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been well studied to overcome the information overload problem in both academia and industry during the past decade. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach in recommender systems, among which Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) has proved very effective. In social networks, users linked together tend to have similar interests and some social-based methods emerged based on this assumption. However these methods treat different friends equally and actually different people may have different influence on a person. Besides social trusts, item relationships also provide rich information especially when trust information is not sufficient. The items liked by the same user may have similar characteristics and whether an item is preferred is influenced by its sim ilar items. But most of these methods ignore the role of item relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation method which incorporates social trusts and item relationships into PMF. We compute user influence degrees and item similarities to weight user-user and item-item relationships when learning user and item latent factors. Experimental results on Epinions dataset demonstrate that our method has shown a significant improvement over existing approaches especially for the users who have made few ratings.

The recommendation is modeled as fluid with two dimensions: the temperature is taken as the 'opinion/rating,' and its volume is deemed as the 'persistency,' representing how much one insists on his opinion. When new opinions come, each user refines his opinion through a round of fluid exchange with his neighbors. Opinions from multiple rounds are aggregated to gain a final prediction; both uniform and non-uniform aggregation are tested. Moreover, Three sampling approaches are proposed and examined. The experimental evaluation of a real data set validates the feasibility of the proposed model, and also demonstrates its effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing need to manage trust in open systems as they may contain untrustworthy service providers. Agent Trust Management (ATM) tries to address the problem of finding a set of the most trusted agents in multi agent systems. This paper presents ScubAA, a novel generic ATM framework based on the theory of Human Plausible Reasoning (HPR). For each user's request, ScubAA determines a ranked list of the most trusted service agents, within the context of the request, and forwards the request to those trusted services only. ScubAA determines an agent's degree of trust in terms of a single personalized value derived from several types of evidences such as user's feedback, history of user's interactions, context of the submitted request, references from third party users as well as from third party service agents, and structure of the society of agents. ScubAA is able to utilize more trust evidences towards a more accurate value of trust. We also propose a function to figure out how similar two users are in a given context. We apply the proposed HPR-based ATM framework to the domain of Web search. The resulting ATM system recommends to the user a list of the most trusted search engines ranked according to the retrieval precision of documents returned in response to the user's query as well as the degree of trust of the search engines have gained by interacting with other related users within the context of the query. In addition, we conduct a statistical analysis of ScubAA based on ANOVA and by using a data set of forty queries in different domains. This analysis clearly reveals that ScubAA is able to successfully assess the trustworthiness of service agents. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {These days, due to growing the e-commerce sites, access to information about items is easier than past. But because of huge amount of information, we need new filtering techniques to find interested information faster and more accurate. Therefore Recommender Systems (RS) introduced for solving this problem. Although several recommender approaches have proposed, Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches are the most successful ones. These approaches use historical behaviors of users for making recommendation. Next generation of CF, called Trust-based CF, use social relations and activities for measuring trust between users. One important step in these approaches is measuring the similarity between users, which affect recommendation results. Therefore variety methods for this reason have been proposed. In this paper, we will review and categorize the measurement methods. We will also analyze the methods to identify their characteristics, benefits and drawbacks.},

abstract = {A recommendation system (RS) in a website is increasingly significant for consumer's decision making. A RS includes several important benefits, such as increasing user satisfaction and building user trust. Despite the growing literature that examined the usefulness of a specific attribute of a RS, less is known about which combination of attributes of a RS is preferable and how the combination influences consumer decision making. By using a conjoint analysis, we can further explore the impacts of combination attributes. In a lab experiment, we find that the importance ranking of attributes of a RS for the participants is quite different. Specifically, all the participants consider the attribute, "Explanation for Recommendation", is important. In addition, "Rating" is important for the specific participants. Furthermore, "Comment" seems to be less important to all the participants. Our results have important implications for the design of a RS. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been used to suggest the interesting items such as movies, books and songs according to the choice of users. These systems compute a user similarity among users and use it as a weight for the users' ratings. However, they have many weaknesses, such as sparseness, cold start and vulnerability to attacks. The traditional recommender system techniques are often ineffective and are not able to compute a user similarity weight for many of the users. The trust among two or more users in the web of trust increases the quality of recommendation in two ways. Firstly, the trust metrics reduce the computability of similarity assessment of users or items. Secondly, the reputation of users may be computed using trust propagation. In this paper, architecture of trust-based recommender systems is proposed. In which trust metrics and rating matrix are taken as input and neighbours are generated using trust metrics and user similarity respectively and importance of trust over collaborative filtering is described. In the proposed approach, trust-based issues are discussed to solve the problem of traditional recommender system such as, data sparsity, cold-start users, malicious attacks on recommender systems and centralised architectures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of "Web of Things" (WoT), there is a pressing need to develop effective mechanisms for the intelligent discovery and selection of these things (items). Recommender systems are viable solutions to address the issue of WoT discovery and selection. However, classical recommender systems are weak in handling sparse recommendation spaces which characterize most WoT recommendations. Moreover, classical recommender systems may not be able to scale up to efficiently process a large number of things on the Web, and yet these systems may produce big-error recommendations that diminish users' trusts on utilizing WoT. The main contribution of our research is the design and development of a novel recommendation method which is underpinned by the principle of object typicality verified in the field of cognitive psychology to address the aforementioned issues related to WoT recommendations. Based on the MovieLens benchmark data set, our experimental results show that the proposed recommendation method is effective and produces the least big-errors. Since the proposed method exploits data generalization by operating at item group and user group level during recommendation time, it is more effective and efficient than other baseline methods given sparse training data. Based on the Netflix benchmark data set that simulates a large WoT recommendation space, the proposed method also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The business implication of our research is that the proposed recommendation method can enhance the situation awareness of WoT applications which facilitate the reuse of enterprise resources and the interoperability among enterprises. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the outsourced data in the cloud and the computation results are not always trustworthy because of the lack of physical possession and control over the data for data owners as a result of using to virtualization, replication and migration techniques. Since that the security protection the threats to outsourced data have become a very challenging and potentially formidable task in cloud computing, many researchers have focused on ameliorating this problem and enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security using remote data auditing (RDA) techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the remote data storage auditing in single cloud server domain and presents taxonomy of RDA approaches. The objective of this paper is to highlight issues and challenges to current RDA protocols in the cloud and the mobile cloud computing. We discuss the thematic taxonomy of RDA based on significant parameters such as security requirements, security metrics, security level, auditing mode, and update mode. The state-of-the-art RDA approaches that have not received much coverage in the literature are also critically analyzed and classified into three groups of provable data possession, proof of retrievability, and proof of ownership to present a taxonomy. It also investigates similarities and differences in such framework and discusses open research issues as the future directions in RDA research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {User-based collaborative filtering systems suggest interesting items to a user relying on similar-minded people called neighbors. The selection and weighting of these neighbors characterize the different recommendation approaches. While standard strategies perform a neighbor selection based on user similarities, trust-aware recommendation algorithms rely on other aspects indicative of user trust and reliability. In this article we restate the trust-aware recommendation problem, generalizing it in terms of performance prediction techniques, whose goal is to predict the performance of an information retrieval system in response to a particular query. We investigate how to adopt the preceding generalization to define a unified framework where we conduct an objective analysis of the effectiveness (predictive power) of neighbor scoring functions. The proposed framework enables discriminating whether recommendation performance improvements are caused by the used neighbor scoring functions or by the ways these functions are used in the recommendation computation. We evaluated our approach with several state-of-the-art and novel neighbor scoring functions on three publicly available datasets. By empirically comparing four neighbor quality metrics and thirteen performance predictors, we found strong predictive power for some of the predictors with respect to certain metrics. This result was then validated by checking the final performance of recommendation strategies where predictors are used for selecting and/or weighting user neighbors. As a result, we have found that, by measuring the predictive power of neighbor performance predictors, we are able to anticipate which predictors are going to perform better in neighbor-scoring-powered versions of a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

While existing literature on trust originating in computer science mostly revolves around aspects of information security, authentication, etc., research on trust in automation - originating from behavioral sciences - almost exclusively focuses on the sociotechnical context in which applications are embedded. The behavioral theory of trust in automation aims at explaining the formation of trust, helping to identify countermeasures for users' uncertainties that lead to lessened trust in an application. We hence propose an approach to augment the system development process of ubiquitous systems with insights into behavioral trust theory. Our approach enables developers to derive design elements that help foster trust in their application by performing four key activities: identifying users' uncertainties, linking them to trust antecedents from theory, deducting functional requirements and finally designing trust-supporting design elements (TSDEs). Evaluating user feedback on two recommender system prototypes, gathered in a study with over 160 participants, we show that by following our process, we were able to derive four TSDEs that helped to significantly increase the users' trust in the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, the emergence of social networks has changed the main activities performed by users on the Internet, going from a mere search and navigation over stored information to a direct interaction with other users. Users have evolved from being consumers of information to real producers (what is known as the transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0). Due to the increasing number of heterogeneous users and information that is generated, their unpredictable behavior and the high dynamism of the network structure, users have to cope with a high degree of uncertainty when choosing who to interact to or what information to consume [1]. In order to deal with this uncertainty, users require tools that help them to make decisions regarding their activities within the network. Recommendation systems [2] [3], which are systems that provide effective recommendations about what action users can take or what information they can consume, can be effective tools for performing theses decision-support tasks.

abstract = {Collaborative filtering-based recommenders operate on the assumption that similar users share similar tastes; however, due to data sparsity of the input ratings matrix, traditional collaborative filtering methods suffer from low accuracy because of the difficulty in finding similar users and the lack of knowledge about the preference of new users. This paper proposes a recommender system based on interest and trust to provide an enhanced recommendations quality. The proposed method incorporates trust derived from both explicit and implicit feedback data to solve the problem of data sparsity. New users can highly benefit from aggregated trust and interest in the form of reputation and popularity of a user as a recommender. The performance is evaluated using two datasets of different sparsity levels, viz. Jester dataset and MovieLens dataset, and are compared with traditional collaborative filtering-based approaches for generating recommendations. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

Collaborative filtering is a widely adopted approach to recommendation, but sparse data and cold-start users are often barriers to providing high quality recommendations. To address such issues, we propose a novel method that works to improve the performance of collaborative filtering recommendations by integrating sparse rating data given by users and sparse social trust network among these same users. This is a model-based method that adopts matrix factorization technique that maps users into low-dimensional latent feature spaces in terms of their trust relationship, and aims to more accurately reflect the users reciprocal influence on the formation of their own opinions and to learn better preferential patterns of users for high-quality recommendations. We use four large-scale datasets to show that the proposed method performs much better, especially for cold start users, than state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for social collaborative filtering based on trust.},

To reduce uncertainty and boost collaborations in such setting, it is important to provide trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms so that trustworthy partners/entities can be easily found. In this work, we propose a novel trustworthiness evaluation mechanism by enhancing existing mechanisms with similarity and non-negative constraints. To be specific, we first extend an existing multi-aspect trust inference model by incorporating the non-negative constraint. One of the advantages of such constraint is its strong interpretability. Second, we incorporate similarity into two neighborhood models borrowed from recommender systems. When computing similarity, we make use of the intermediate results from the first step. Finally, these models are combined under a machine learning framework. To show the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on a real data-set. The results show that: both our non-negativity extension and similarity computation improve the evaluation accuracy of the original methods, and the combined method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper we consider ways intelligent agents should explain themselves to end users, especially focusing on how the soundness and completeness of the explanations impacts the fidelity of end users' mental models. Our findings suggest that completeness is more important than soundness: increasing completeness via certain information types helped participants' mental models and, surprisingly, their perception of the cost/benefit tradeoff of attending to the explanations. We also found that oversimplification, as per many commercial agents, can be a problem: when soundness was very low, participants experienced more mental demand and lost trust in the explanations, thereby reducing the likelihood that users will pay attention to such explanations at all. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This paper presents a method to make recommendations for scientists based on trust. We first propose an extended provenance model that captures users' behavioral information during scientific workflow execution. Such provenance information can be used to compute the user's trust in data and mutual trust degree between users. Then based on predicted trust value, data files can be recommended to users.

abstract = {Trust prediction, which explores the unobserved relationships between online community users, is an emerging and important research topic in social network analysis and many web applications. Similar to other social-based recommender systems, trust relationships between users can be also modeled in the form of matrices. Recent study shows users generally establish friendship due to a few latent factors, it is therefore reasonable to assume the trust matrices are of low-rank. As a result, many recommendation system strategies can be applied here. In particular, trace norm minimization, which uses matrix's trace norm to approximate its rank, is especially appealing. However, recent articles cast doubts on the validity of trace norm approximation. In this paper, instead of using trace norm minimization, we propose a new robust rank-k matrix completion method, which explicitly seeks a matrix with exact rank. Moreover, our method is robust to noise or corrupted observations. We optimize the new objective function in an alternative manner, based on a combination of ancillary variables and Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) Method. We perform the experiments on three real-world data sets and all empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of mobile web, social networking services (SNSs) are an integral part of our everyday lives, since they are used for communicating with friends, for gaining information on other people or some items of interest, and even for business profits. Social network information is incorporated into recommender systems to improve their performance, but most of existing work is focused on user-centric cases in which items or venues are recommended for users. On the other hand, brands are also important social objects. For instance, in Foursquare, which is a location-based online SNS, brands provide information on venues and share the tips with their followers. Thus, it is important to recommend venues for brands so that brands select interesting venues for their followers, leading to brand-centric recommendation where the targets for recommendation are brands (not users). In contrast to user-centric recommendation, brands have few social links to other brands, so trust between brands is difficult to use. In this paper we present a method for brand-centric recommendation where inter-brand similarities are implicitly determined by decomposing a brand-follower matrix. This social information on inter-brand similarity is incorporated into probabilistic matrix factorization to reveal brand latent factors as well as venue latent factors. Experiments on the dataset collected from Foursquare (by web crawling) demonstrate that our method improves the recommendation performance over existing matrix factorizations. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

The unique features of our friend recommendation algorithms are that they capture different behaviours by (a) distinguishing between passive and active behaviours, (b) classifying behaviours as contributing to users' popularity or engagement and (c) considering different member activities in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we present our social trust based recommendation algorithms and evaluate them against algorithms based on the social graph (such as Friends-Of-A-Friend).

abstract = {Intelligent things are widely connected in Internet of Things (IoT) to enable ubiquitous service access. This may cause heavy service redundant. The trust-aware recommender system (TARS) is therefore proposed for IoT to help users finding reliable services. One fundamental requirement of TARS is to efficiently find as many recommenders as possible for the active users. To achieve this, existing approaches of TARS choose to search the entire trust network, which have very high computational cost. Though the trust network is the scale-free network, we show via experiments that TARS cannot find satisfactory number of recommenders by directly applying the classical searching mechanism. In this paper, we propose an efficient searching mechanism, named S_Searching: based on the scale-freeness of trust networks, choosing the global highest-degree nodes to construct a Skeleton, and searching the recommenders via this Skeleton. Benefiting from the superior outdegrees of the nodes in the Skeleton, S_Searching can find the recommenders very efficiently. Experimental results show that S_Searching can find almost the same number of recommenders as that of conducting full search, which is much more than that of applying the classical searching mechanism in the scale-free network, while the computational complexity and cost is much less.},

abstract = {Utilizing social network information to improve recommendation quality has recently attracted much attention. However, most existing social recommendation models cannot well handle the heterogeneity and diversity of the social relationships (e.g., different friends may have different recommendations on the same items in different situations). Furthermore, few models take into account (non-social) contextual information, which has been proved to be another valuable information source for accurate recommendation. In this paper, we propose to construct trust networks on top of a social network to measure the quality of a friend's recommendations in different contexts. We employ random walk to collect the most relevant ratings based on the multi-dimensional trustworthiness of users in the trust network. Factorization machines model is then applied on the collected ratings to predict missing ratings considering various contexts. Evaluation based on a real dataset demonstrates that our approach improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art social, context-aware and trust-aware recommendation models by at least 5.54% and 9.15% in terms of MAE and RMSE respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems are a class of applications which are used to overcome the problem of information overload. They use the opinions of members of a community to help individuals in that community identify the information most likely to be interesting to them or relevant to their needs, by drawing on user preferences and filtering the set of possible options to a more manageable subset. The key element of such user-support systems is the user model. Traditional techniques used to create user models are usually too rigid to capture the inherent uncertainty of human behavior. Fuzzy sets can handle and process uncertainty in human decision-making and if used in user modeling can be of advantage as it will result in recommendations closely meeting user preferences. In this paper, a hybrid multi-agent recommender system is designed and developed where user's preferences; needs and satisfaction are modeled using interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets. This results in improving the prediction accuracy of the system and hence better recommendations are generated. Experimental study was conducted on book recommender system and promising results were obtained. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Similarly, direct clinical experience may offer experimental results and conclusions which may lead, guide and foster new investigations. However, this interaction between research and clinical practice is yet too far from being optimal. On one side, research results are published without standardization, suffering terminological issues, which prevent its automatic handling and great scale information treatment/management. On the other, for the practitioner, the task of reviewing papers, bibliography, experimental results, etc. in order to keep updated his everyday clinical practice, is very time consuming, causing not to be done continuously. The implantation of Information Technologies in the biomedical research field has developed numerous search and bibliographic management resources, existing a current trend towards building and publishing open access terminologies, ontological knowledge models and big datasets with biomedical content. All together, beside Semantic Web technologies, methodologies and Linked Open Data and AI techniques, conforms a technological framework which gives the opportunity to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice to support the physician in evidence based decision making. In this work, as a starting point to the final aim of linking research and clinical practice, we describe a Semantic Bibliographical Recommender System (SBRS) based on patient profile integrated with electronic health record (EHR) which, without closing the loop, offers to the medical professional the latest and most significant experimental evidences related to his concrete case study.

abstract = {Recommender systems are becoming a salient part of many e-commerce websites. Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, although behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013, INFORMS.},

abstract = {With the advent of social networks, trust-aware recommendation methods have been well studied. Most of these algorithms assume that trusted users will have similar tastes. However, this assumption ignores the fact that two users may establish a trust connection for the social purpose or simply for etiquette, which may not result in similar opinions on the same item. Motivated by this observation, a novel trust strength aware social recommendation method, StrengthMF, is firstly proposed. Compared with previous methods, this new approach assumes that a trust relation does not necessarily guarantee the similarity in preferences between two users. Specificly, StrengthMF learns the trust strength and distinguishes users with more similar interests through the shared user latent feature space, i. e., the user latent feature space in trust network is the same in the rating matrix. This will allow us to acquire a better understanding of the relationship between trust relation and rating similarity. To validate the learned trust strength, InfluenceMF method is then proposed, which retrains SocialMF with estimated trust relations. Experimental results on real world product rating data set Epinions show that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of RMSE and MAE, and the learned trust strength can further improve traditional recommendation methods.},

Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation.

This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm.

abstract = {Given the vast amount of information on theWorldWideWeb, recommender systems are increasingly being used to help filter irrelevant data and suggest information that would interest users. Traditional systems make recommendations based on a single domain e.g., movie or book domain. Recent work has examined the correlations in different domains and designed models that exploit user preferences on a source domain to predict user preferences on a target domain. However, these methods are based on matrix factorization and can only be applied to two-dimensional data. Transferring high dimensional data from one domain to another requires decomposing the high dimensional data to binary relations which results in information loss. Furthermore, this decomposition creates a large number of matrices that need to be transferred and combining them in the target domain is non-Trivial. Separately, researchers have looked into using social network information to improve recommendation. However, this social network information has not been explored in cross domain collaborative filtering. In this work, we propose a generalized cross domain collaborative filtering framework that integrates social network information seamlessly with cross domain data. This is achieved by utilizing tensor factorization with topic based social regularization. This framework is able to transfer high dimensional data without the need for decomposition by finding shared implicit cluster-level tensor from multiple domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real world datasets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms stateof-Art algorithms for item recommendation, user recommendation and tag recommendation.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have been used in various application domains to solve the information-overload problem. Recently, trust-based recommender systems have incorporated the trustworthiness of users into CF techniques in order to improve recommendation quality. Some researchers have proposed rating-based trust models to derive trust values based on users' past ratings of items, or based on explicitly specified relations (e.g. friends) or trust relationships; however, the rating-based trust model may not be effective in CF recommendations due to unreliable trust values derived from very few past rating records. In this work, we propose a hybrid personal trust model which adaptively combines the rating-based trust model and explicit trust metric to resolve the drawback caused by insufficient past rating records. Moreover, users with similar preferences usually form a group to share items (knowledge) with each other; thus, users' preferences may be affected by group members. Accordingly, group trust can enhance personal trust to support recommendations from the group perspective. We then propose a recommendation method based on a hybrid model of personal and group trust to improve recommendation performance. The experimental results show that the proposed models can improve the prediction accuracy of other trust-based recommender systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The growing intelligence and popularity of smartphones and the advances in Mobile Ubiquitous Computing have resulted in rapid proliferation of data-sharing applications. Instances of these applications include pervasive social networking, games, file sharing and so on. In such scenarios, users are usually involved in selecting the peers with whom communication should take place, continuously facing trust issues. Unfortunately, providing trust support in a pervasive world is challenging due to peer mobility and lack in central control. We propose a novel approach that establishes trust leveraging users' profiles: humans today produce rich strings of unique data twenty-four hours a day. These information enables a task-Aware trust model, namely a finer-grained model in which users are classified as trusted or not depending on the intended business activity. However, simply collecting user's interests may be insufficient to provide a reasonable trust management system. In order to enable the system to recognize malicious users, we include a recommendation subsystem based on the Wilson score confidence interval. It has been designed to be lightweight, minimizing battery depletion. It also protects user privacy. To make our approach fully deployable, it supports two modalities: A TPM-based one and a TPM-less one. The former gives more security guarantees and ensures a fully distributed approach. The latter, requires a Trusted Authority to avoid feedbacks to get tampered and is no more fully distributed. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Existing recommender systems model user interests and the social influences independently. In reality, user interests may change over time, and as the interests change, new friends may be added while old friends grow apart and the new friendships formed may cause further interests change. This complex interaction requires the joint modeling of user interest and social relationships over time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called Receptive-ness over Time Model (RTM), to capture this interaction. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to learn the receptive-ness and interest distributions among users over time. The results of experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate that RTM-based recommendation outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Case studies also show that RTM is able to discover the user interest shift and re-ceptiveness change over time. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Recommendation Services (RS) are an essential part of online marketing campaigns. They make it possible to automatically suggest advertisements and promotions that fit the interests of individual users. Social networking websites, and the Web 2.0 in general, offer a collaborative online platform where users socialize, interact and discuss topics of interest with each other. These websites have created an abundance of information about users and their interests. The computational challenge however is to analyze and filter this information in order to generate useful recommendations for each user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a recommendation service technique that collects information from a user's preferences and from trusted peer users in order to infer a new targeted suggestion. CF and its variants have been studied extensively in the literature on online recommending, marketing and advertising systems. However, most of the work done was based on Web 1.0, where all the information necessary for the computations is assumed to always be completely available. By contrast, in the distributed environment of Web 2.0, such as in current social networks, the required information may be either incomplete or scattered over different sources. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Collaborative Filtering Trust Network algorithm, an improved version of the CF algorithm designed to work on the Web 2.0 platform. Our simulation experiments show that the new algorithm yields a clear improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the original CF algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Collective view prediction is to judge the opinions of an active web user based on unknown elements by referring to the collective mind of the whole community. Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering are two mainstream collective view prediction techniques. They generate predictions by analyzing the text features of the target object or the similarity of users' past behaviors. Still, these techniques are vulnerable to the artificially-injected noise data, because they are not able to judge the reliability and credibility of the information sources. Trust-based Collective View Prediction describes new approaches for tackling this problem by utilizing users' trust relationships from the perspectives of fundamental theory, trust-based collective view prediction algorithms and real case studies. The book consists of two main parts - a theoretical foundation and an algorithmic study. The first part will review several basic concepts and methods related to collective view prediction, such as state-of-the-art recommender systems, sentimental analysis, collective view, trust management, the Relationship of Collective View and Trustworthy, and trust in collective view prediction. In the second part, the authors present their models and algorithms based on a quantitative analysis of more than 300 thousand users' data from popular product-reviewing websites. They also introduce two new trust-based prediction algorithms, one collaborative algorithm based on the second-order Markov random walk model, and one Bayesian fitting model for combining multiple predictors. The discussed concepts, developed algorithms, empirical results, evaluation methodologies and the robust analysis framework described in Trust-based Collective View Prediction will not only provide valuable insights and findings to related research communities and peers, but also showcase the great potential to encourage industries and business partners to integrate these techniques into new applications.},

abstract = {Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems on the basis of user similarity often suffer from low accuracy because of the difficulty in finding similar users. Incorporating trust network into CF-based recommender system is an attractive approach to resolve the neighbor selection problem. Most existing trust-based CF methods assume that underlying relationships (whether inferred or pre-existing) can be described and reasoned in a web of trust. However, in online sharing communities or e-commerce sites, a web of trust is not always available and is typically sparse. The limited and sparse web of trust strongly affects the quality of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel method that establishes and exploits a two-faceted web of trust on the basis of users' personal activities and relationship networks in online sharing communities or e-commerce sites, to provide enhanced-quality recommendations. The developed web of trust consists of interest similarity graphs and directed trust graphs and mitigates the sparsity of web of trust. Moreover, the proposed method captures the temporal nature of trust and interest by dynamically updating the two-faceted web of trust. Furthermore, this method adapts to the differences in user rating scales by using a modified Resnick's prediction formula. As enabled by the Pareto principle and graph theory, new users highly benefit from the aggregated global interest similarity (popularity) in interest similarity graph and the global trust (reputation) in the directed trust graph. The experiments on two datasets with different sparsity levels (i.e., Jester and MovieLens datasets) show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the predictive accuracy and decision-support accuracy of the trust-based CF recommender system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although the importance of trust in recommender systems is widely recognized, the actual mechanisms of trust propagation and trust preservation are poorly understood. This is partly due to the fact that trust is a complex notion, which is typically context dependent, subjective, dynamic and not always transitive or symmetrical. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the notion of trust in news recommendation and discusses the advantages of modeling this notion using Defeasible Logic Programming, a general-purpose defeasible argumentation formalism based on logic programming. In the proposed framework, users can express explicit trust statements on news reports, news sources and other users. Trust is then modeled and propagated using a dialectical process supported by a Defeasible Logic Programming interpreter. A set of basic postulates for trust and their representation by means of defeasible rules is presented. The suitability of the approach is investigated with a set of illustrative examples and then analyzed from a formal perspective. The obtained results indicate that the proposed framework provides a solid foundation for building trust-based news recommendation services. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Trust models have received considerable attention in the recent past and have been employed in many of today's most successful recommender systems (RSs) for alleviating sparsity by enhancing their interuser connectivity obtained from historical preference data and to address the cold start problem. However, the incorporation of distrust in addition to trust for improved recommendations has not been analyzed fully because of the absence of publically available data sets containing gradual information about trust and distrust concepts. Our work in this paper is an attempt toward introducing recommendation strategies exploiting both the trust and the distrust in the RSs to further enhance their quality of recommendations through fuzzy computational models for trust and distrust. Since trust and distrust concepts are gradual phenomenon, therefore these can be represented more naturally by fuzzy logic using linguistic expressions. The contributions of this paper are three fold: First, we propose fuzzy computational models for both the trust and distrust concepts through similarity as well as knowledge factors based on linguistic expressions. Second, we suggest appropriate propagation and aggregation operators to deal with the data sparsity. Finally, we present a comparative analysis of proposed recommendation strategies utilizing both the trust and distrust concepts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Personalization relies on personal data about each individual user. Users are quite often reluctant though to disclose information about themselves and to be "tracked" by a system. We investigated whether different types of rationales (justifications) for disclosure that have been suggested in the privacy literature would increase users' willingness to divulge demographic and contextual information about themselves, and would raise their satisfaction with the system. We also looked at the effect of the order of requests, owing to findings from the literature. Our experiment with a mockup of a mobile app recommender shows that there is no single strategy that is optimal for everyone. Heuristics can be defined though that select for each user the most effective justification to raise disclosure or satisfaction, taking the user's gender, disclosure tendency, and the type of solicited personal information into account. We discuss the implications of these findings for research aimed at personalizing privacy strategies to each individual user. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

An explanation such as"I believe you will like this item, but I do not have enough information to be fully confident about it." may mitigate the issue, but can also damage user trust because it alerts users to the fact that the system might be wrong. The findings in this paper suggest that there is a way of modelling recommendation confidence that is related to accuracy (MAE, RMSE and NDCG) and user rating behaviour (rated vs unrated items). In particular, it was found that unrated items have lower confidence compared to the entire item set - highlighting the importance of explanations for novel but risky recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems analyze the purchasing behavior (e.g.; item ratings) of users to learn about their preferences and recommend products or services that may be of interest to them. However, as new users require time to become familiar with recommendation systems, the systems usually have limited information about newcomers and have difficulty providing appropriate recommendations. This so-called new user cold start phenomenon has a serious impact on the performance of recommendation systems. As a result, there has been increasing research in recent years into new user cold start recommendation methods that try to provide useful item recommendations for cold start new users. The rationale behind much of the research is that recommending items to new users generally creates a sense of belonging and loyalty, and encourages them to frequently utilize recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a cold start recommendation method for the new user that integrates a user model with trust and distrust networks to identify trustworthy users. The suggestions of these users are then aggregated to provide useful recommendations for cold start new users. Experiments based on the well-known Epinions dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Moreover, the method outperforms well-known recommendation methods for cold start new users in terms of the recall rate, F1 score, coverage rate, users coverage, and execution time, without a significant reduction in the precision of the recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The rating similarity between a pair of friends is measured by a set of conditional probabilities derived from their mutual rating history. A user propagates a content rating query along the social network to his direct and indirect friends. Based on the query responses, a Bayesian network is constructed to infer the rating of the querying user. We develop distributed protocols that can be easily implemented in online social networks. We further propose to use Prior distribution to cope with cold start and rating sparseness. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using two different online rating data sets of real users. We show that the proposed Bayesian-inference-based recommendation is better than the existing trust-based recommendations and is comparable to Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation. It allows the flexible tradeoffs between recommendation quality and recommendation quantity. We further show that informative Prior distribution is indeed helpful to overcome cold start and rating sparseness. {\textcopyright} 1990-2012 IEEE.},

However, the investigation into the utility of distrust in the recommendation process is in its infancy. We propose a collaborative filtering framework based on computing user trust by exploiting functional and referral trust and distrust information together with user preference data. The inclusion of multiple sources of opinions for computing trust results in improved coverage and the trust network so formed can be used to infer indirect trust between entities by exploiting transitivity of trust. We also quantify the risk in relying on trust statements as a function of knowledge contained in the statement and the conflict in opinions about an entity and argue that pruning the trust graph by discarding risky and retaining reliable trust statements results in more accurate and robust recommendations while not compromising on the coverage. The experimental results corroborate our ideas and outperform several baseline algorithms.},

abstract = {Recommender systems increasingly use contextual and demographical data as a basis for recommendations. Users, however, often feel uncomfortable providing such information. In a privacy-minded design of recommenders, users are free to decide for themselves what data they want to disclose about themselves. But this decision is often complex and burdensome, because the consequences of disclosing personal information are uncertain or even unknown. Although a number of researchers have tried to analyze and facilitate such information disclosure decisions, their research results are fragmented, and they often do not hold up well across studies. This article describes a unified approach to privacy decision research that describes the cognitive processes involved in users' "privacy calculus" in terms of system-related perceptions and experiences that act as mediating factors to information disclosure. The approach is applied in an online experiment with 493 participants using a mock-up of a context-aware recommender system. Analyzing the results with a structural linear model, we demonstrate that personal privacy concerns and disclosure justification messages affect the perception of and experience with a system, which in turn drive information disclosure decisions. Overall, disclosure justification messages do not increase disclosure. Although they are perceived to be valuable, they decrease users' trust and satisfaction. Another result is that manipulating the order of the requests increases the disclosure of items requested early but decreases the disclosure of items requested later. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

Our most significant result is that the personality trait of Conscientious is consistently positively correlated with a higher opinion about the usefulness and trustworthiness of recommendations, self-reports of how frequently they were used, and ratings of recommended items. We discuss the implications these results have for evaluating and improving recommender systems. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {During the last years, RDF datasets from almost any knowledge domain have been published in the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud. The Linked Open Data guidelines establish the conditions to be satisfied by resources in order to be included as part of the LOD cloud, as well as connected to previously published data. The process of publication and linkage of resources in the LOD cloud relies on: i) data cleaning and transformation into existing RDF formats, ii) storage of the data into RDF storage systems, and iii) data interlinking. Because of data source heterogeneity, generated RDF data may be ambiguous and links may be incomplete with respect to this data. Users of the Web of Data require linked data to meet high quality standards in order to develop applications that can produce trustworthy results, but data in the LOD cloud has not been curated; thus, tools are necessary to detect data quality problems. For example, researchers that study Life Sciences datasets to explain phenomena or identify anomalies, demand that their findings correspond to current discoveries, and not to the effect of low data quality standards of completeness or redundancy. In this paper we propose LiQuate, a system that uses Bayesian networks to study the incompleteness of links, and ambiguities between labels and between links in the LOD cloud, and can be applied to any domain. Additionally, a probabilistic rule-based system is used to infer new links that associate equivalent resources, and allow to resolve the ambiguities and incompleteness identified during the exploration of the Bayesian network. As a proof of concept, we applied LiQuate to existing Life Sciences linked datasets, and detected ambiguities in the data, that may compromise the confidence of the results of applications such as link prediction or pattern discovery. We illustrate a variety of identified problems and propose a set of enriched intra- and inter-links that may improve the quality of data items and links of specific datasets of the LOD cloud. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed the explosive growth of microblogging services. As a popular platform for users to communicate and share information with friends, microblog has opened up new opportunities for recommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility of recommending TV programs with microb-logs. In particular, we leverage the following two important features of microblogs: (1) the rich user generated content reveals users' preferences on TV programs as well as the properties of TV programs and (2) the social interactions of the users suggest the mutual influences among the users. Taking into consideration of the above two properties, we proposed a hybrid recommendation model based on probabilistic matrix factorization, a popular collaborative filtering method. Two regularizers are added during matrix factorization: the social regularizer and the item similarity regularizer. We validate the proposed algorithm with Sina Weibo data set for TV program recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering method, demonstrating the importance of incorporating social trust and item similarity in recommendation. In addition, we show that the proposed method is robust in recommending to new users, a typical cold-start scenario. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The development of social network has increased the importance of social recommendation. However, social recommender systems have only recently been given research attention. Social relationships between users, especially trust relationships, can facilitate the design of social recommender systems. Such systems are based on the idea that users linked by a social network tend to share similar interests. Existing recommender approaches based on social trust relationships do not fully utilize such relationships and thus have low prediction accuracy or slow convergence speed. We propose a factor analysis approach that explicitly and implicitly uses social trust relationships simultaneously to overcome this limitation and fully utilize social trust relationships. Our approach combines the advantages of the existing two approaches, social recommendation using probabilistic matrix factorization and learning to recommend with social trust ensemble. Based on Epinions data sets, our approach has both significantly higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than traditional collaborative filtering technology and state-of-the-art trust-based recommendation approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We used four additional datasets. either to supplement information or to generate enriched contexts: Dbpedia. Geonames.

The featured applications are: faceted searches, enriched contexts, navigation through graphs and graphic visualization in charts or geographic maps. Faceted searches can be performed on three basic items: scientific publications, researchers (authors of the publications) and organizations in the learning analytics area. The search engine enables aggregated searches by different facets and summarization of results for each successive search. Analytics on data are provided firstly through that summarization given for results in every facet, and secondly through dynamic graphic representations for some attributes. Several charts are available to show the distribution of publications depending on different attributes (e.g. per publication type and year or per organization). The search results for organizations and researchers can be visualized in geographic maps. This work was presented to the LAK Data Challenge 2013.},

Although collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been widely deployed in many applications, it still pay little attention to social actions, which are widely common in social networks and we believe could make a significant improvement in recommender systems. In this paper, we incorporate users' social actions into a model-based approach for recommendation using probabilistic matrix factorization. Compared with previous work, users' social actions are taken as a new relation to optimize previous trust-based recommender systems. To achieve this, we propose a social recommendation graphical model employing users' relations based on their social actions. We make use of users' commenting action in our approach and conduct experiments on a real life dataset, extracted from the Douban movie ratings and comments system. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating users' social action information leads to a significant improvement in recommender systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The introduction of data stream mining has opened a window for extending data mining to be used in VANETs.

Vehicles exchange different types of messages either periodically or ad hoc for different types of applications. The data flowing in the network of vehicles can be used to extract valuable knowledge to support the different applications in VANETs. Knowledge gained from the data can be used to form groups of vehicles. Vehicles can be grouped together based on their direction of traveling, speed, the types of applications they run. Vehicles that have common features, interests, and needs facilitate the establishment of trust between them as these shared features make up the foundation for trust.

abstract = {Models of computational trust support users in taking decisions. They are commonly used to guide users' judgements in online auction sites; or to determine quality of contributions in Web 2.0 sites. However, most existing systems require historical information about the past behavior of the specific agent being judged. In contrast, in real life, to anticipate and to predict a stranger's actions in absence of the knowledge of such behavioral history, we often use our "instinct"-essentially stereotypes developed from our past interactions with other "similar" persons. In this paper, we propose StereoTrust, a computational trust model inspired by stereotypes as used in real-life. A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected outcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust by aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger's profile. Since stereotypes are formed locally, recommendations stem from the trustor's own personal experiences and perspective. Historical behavioral information, when available, can be used to refine the analysis. According to our experiments using Epinions.com dataset, StereoTrust compares favorably with existing trust models that use different kinds of information and more complete historical information. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The recent explosion of Big Data is offering new chances and challenges to all those platforms that provide personalized access to information sources, such as recommender systems and personalized search engines. In this context, social networks are gaining more and more interests since they represent a perfect source to trigger personalization tasks. Indeed, users naturally leave on these platforms a lot of data about their preferences, feelings, and friendships. Hence, those data are really valuable for addressing the cold start problem of recommender systems. On the other hand, since content shared on social networks is noisy and heterogeneous, information extracted must be hardly processed to build user profiles that can effectively mirror user interests and needs. In this paper we investigated the effectiveness of external knowledge derived from Wikipedia in representing both documents and user profiles in a recommendation scenario. Specifically, we compared a classical keyword-based representation with two techniques that are able to map unstructured text with Wikipedia pages. The advantage of using this representation is that documents and user profiles become richer, more human-readable, less noisy, and potentially connected to the Linked Open Data (lod) cloud. The goal of our preliminary experimental evaluation was twofolds: 1) to define the representation that best reflects user preferences; 2) to define the representation that provides the best predictive accuracy. We implemented a news recommender for a preliminary evaluation of our model. We involved more than 50 Facebook and Twitter users and we demonstrated that the encyclopedic-based representation is an effective way for modeling both user profiles and documents. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous adoption of Internet technologies in almost every private, economic and social sector is overwhelming. Trust and trustworthiness are central notions in such networked environments: users accept a service in their everyday life and may be willing to pay for it only if they perceive that they can trust the service providers and the involved (software) technologies. Trust itself is the transdisciplinary result of technical, sociological and legal aspects. Trust relationships must be established, verified, monitored, maintained and, if necessary, certifiably adapted during any further evolution. To this end, trust inevitably requires formalization, best in the form of comprehensive formalized models and methods. There has been extensive work done towards understanding and formalizing trust: trust is largely built from experience. Trust policies are used to formalize the evaluation of experiences with respect to trust. The results of trust policies are however hard to assess for software-based systems consisting of various components from different sources. It is e.g. open how to assess trustworthiness of software components or it is open how to select trust policies that result in a more successful choice of trusted software to use. The quality of software-based systems is a major ingredients for trustworthiness. Various methods can be used to assess the quality of the related technical specifications and of the software itself. However, are quality assurance and trust policies already sufficient means for building trustworthy systems and establishing trust? A compelling direction of improving trustworthiness of software-based systems is to open their ingredients: Open source software, open data sets, open system interfaces like open technical standards allow constructing major or up to all elements of a software-based systems. That gives means to use the wisdom of the crowd to assess and evaluate the quality, security and trustworthiness of software components. In addition, the software components can mature along a continuous feedback and revision loop with the crowd. Still, some, but not all software components will have/use open standards, open interfaces, open data and/or open source, so that methods are needed that are able to assess a mixture of open and closed software components. The panel will discuss where we stand in this respect and what is yet to be done towards increased trustworthiness of software-based systems that are constructed from closed and open artifacts in diverse environments. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In 2002, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) published its FAO Country Profiles, an innovative information retrieval system which allows access to FAO's thematic, country-based information from a single entry point. This ontology uses some of the country profiles' underlying data to provide a reusable resource for the international community, with a more streamlined means of accessing country data. Aimed at improving information management, the ontology facilitates standardized data sharing and interoperability, delivering the most updated geopolitical information. This ontology organizes coding systems and multilingual representations and tracks historical changes to geopolitical data as determined by trustworthy data holders like the United Nations. This article will show how the FAO Country Profiles has defined a new standard in geopolitical ontology and how and why the ontology became a reference for country-based information, as well as discuss future challenges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Existing models of the Trust-Aware Recommender System (TARS) build personalized trust networks for the active users to predict ratings. These models have reasonable rating prediction performances, while suffer from high computational complexity. One solution is to utilize the global rating prediction mechanism for TARS, in which an intuitive assumption is that more reputable recommenders give more accurate recommendations. In addition, due to the scale-freeness of the trust network, some users have and continuously have superior reputations than others. However, we show via comprehensive experiments on the real TARS data that the recommendations given by recommenders with higher reputations do not tend to be more accurate. Furthermore, even the recommendations given by the recommenders with superior high reputations do not tend to more accurate. Our experimental study provides promising directions for the future research on the rating prediction mechanism of TARS. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Trust among users in a social network plays an important role when trying to build a social recommender system. To be able to calculate who-trusts-whom and implement that knowledge in the social recommender, it is crucial to examine in detail all possible relations between users in the social network and to evaluate those relations properly. We propose a model to transform a single user's social graph from a binary structure to a structure with the concrete weights between the nodes in a graph. This paper first addresses a question of how can a general model for calculating trust be implemented using a specific social network as a medium (i.e., Facebook). Afterwards, the proposed model is verified through a Facebook application named Closest Friends, which calculates the user's closest friends on the Facebook social network. Finally, our approach has been evaluated with the experiment among the 150 Facebook users who tested Closest Friends application. {\textcopyright} 2012 University of Split.},

abstract = {We focus on the measure of recommendation stability, which reflects the consistency of recommender system predictions. Stability is a desired property of recommendation algorithms and has important implications on users' trust and acceptance of recommendations. Prior research has reported that some popular recommendation algorithms can suffer from a high degree of instability. In this study we propose a scalable, general-purpose iterative smoothing approach that can be used in conjunction with different traditional recommendation algorithms to improve their stability. Our experimental results on real-world rating data demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve substantially higher stability as compared to the original recommendation algorithms. Importantly, the proposed approach not only does not sacrifice the predictive accuracy in order to improve recommendation stability, but is actually able to provide additional accuracy improvements at the same time.},

In this paper, Learning Networks are presented as an open infrastructure to provide teachers with such learning opportunities. However, with the large number of learning resources produced everyday, teachers need to find out what are the most suitable resources for them. In this paper, recommender systems are introduced as a potential solution to address this issue. Unfortunately, most of the educational recommender systems cannot make accurate recommendations due to the sparsity of the educational datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose a research approach that describes how one may take advantage of the social data which are obtained from monitoring the activities of teachers while they are using our social recommender.},

We propose a Trust-aware Clustering Collaborative Filtering and we compare several approaches by means of Epinions, which contains explicit trust statements, and MovieLens dataset, where we have implicitly defined a trust information. Experimental results show an increased value of coverage of the recommendations provided by our approach without affecting recommendation quality. To conclude, we introduce a tool, based on recommender systems, able to assist merchants in delivering special offers or in discovering potential interests of their customers.

We show that recommender systems are multifaceted and can be organized around 4 structuring functions: help users to decide, help users to compare, help users to discover, help users to explore. A global off line protocol is then proposed to evaluate recommender systems. This protocol is based on the definition of appropriate evaluation measures for each aforementioned function. The evaluation protocol is discussed from the perspective of the usefulness and trust of the recommendation. A new measure called Average Measure of Impact is introduced. This measure evaluates the impact of the personalized recommendation. We experiment with two classical methods, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF), using the well known dataset: Netflix. A segmentation of both users and items is proposed to finely analyze where the algorithms perform well or badly. We show that the performance is strongly dependent on the segments and that there is no clear correlation between the RMSE and the quality of the recommendation.},

In particular, we consider a social network of users offering commentary on the web objects they have experienced together with opinions on the value of this commentary being registered by peers. Within this framework, we integrate a reasoner that personalizes the presentation of these annotations to each new user, selectively limiting what is displayed to promote the commentary that will lead to the most effective knowledge gains, based on a modeling of the trustworthiness of the annotator and the similarity of peers who have found this commentary to be useful. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for selective presentation of these web document annotations by constructing a simulation of knowledge gains achieved by users. Our method is shown to approach the ideal knowledge gains achieved by an optimal algorithm, far outpacing a system where a random selection of commentary is offered (as might match what users would experience if employing self-directed limiting of browsing behaviour). As a result, we offer an effective method for enhancing the experiences of users in contexts with potentially massive amounts of peer commentary.},

In light of the social network theories on the formation of a social network and its impact on human behavior, we present a multi-theoretical framework to model multiple facets of social relations for recommendation. Taking a kernel-based framework, we design and select kernels describing individuals' similarities projected by social network theories. Moreover, we employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning approach to combine the kernels to increase the dimension of models on assessing individuals' opinions. We evaluate our proposed framework on a real-world movie review dataset. The experiments show that our framework provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods, the collaborative filtering approach, and individual kernels. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the framework.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems often suffer from the sparsity problem, particularly for new and inactive users when they use the system. The emerging trend of social networking sites can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relationship data, by which users' similar interests might be inferred even with few of their behavioral data with items (e.g., ratings). Previous works mainly focus on the friendship and trust relation in this respect. However, in this paper, we have in-depth explored a new kind of social relationship - the membership and its combinational effect with friendship. The social relationships are fused into the CF recommender via a graph-based framework on sparse and dense datasets as obtained from Last.fm. Our experiments have not only revealed the significant effects of the two relationships, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the outperforming ability of the graph modeling in terms of realizing the optimal fusion mechanism. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Finally, two differentes applications of social recommendation are also shown. This chapter include the authors' view about the open trends and the future of recommendation. Specifically, we understand the current research lines might be ascribed to the following areas (i) the application of data-mining and SNA (Social Network Analysis) to obtain a Social Aggregation Model; (ii) the need for integrating different models and data structures to make interoperability in the Social Web feasible; and (iii) no matter how recommender systems will improve their precision and recall, its deployment must face with and find their natural arrangement in cloud computing environments. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

With the arising and popularization of digital social networks a new field has been opened for social recommendations. Considering the network topology, users interactions, or estimating trust between users are some of the new strategies that recommender systems can take into account in order to adapt their techniques to these new scenarios. We introduce MarkovTrust, a way to infer trust from Twitter interactions and to compute trust between distant users. MarkovTrust is based on Markov chains, which makes it simple to be implemented and computationally efficient. We study the properties of this trust metric and study its application in a recommender system of tweets. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Additionally, this study considers hedonic and utilitarian product characteristics, attempting to present a comprehensive range of recommender system acceptance. A total of 51 participants completed an online 2 (recommender systems) x 2 (products) survey. The results suggested that type of recommender systems and products did have different impacts on the behavioral intention to use recommender systems. This study may be of importance in explaining factors contributing to use recommender systems, as well as in providing designers of recommender systems with a better understanding of how to provide a more effective recommender system. {\textcopyright} (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes a proposed recommendation system and multi-modal interface. In this study, the system aims to provide a solution to need for people with specific skills by recommending dependable people having both needed knowledge and discussion skills. The user has opportunities to quickly reach effective solutions through discussion with people recommended by this system. A procedure using a multi-agent system uses data obtained through a social network represented as architecture of relations. The recommendation system in this study is implemented in this algorithm, supplemented with additional information to describe the comprehensive level of trust between members of the discussion, ratings which are retrieved from those member's evaluations. For some situations, for example, when the user does not agree with the recommendation and wants to update or alter the recommended data, a function has been implemented with which the user can readily coordinate groups. As a way of providing complex information, the multimodal interface represents them with a haptic metaphor for easy understanding and quick manipulation. The use of haptic force feedback displays in the virtual space makes it possible for the user to understand more easily than methods using only the visual modality. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collaborative recommender systems suggest items each user may like or find useful basing on the preferences of other like-minded individuals. Thus, the main concern in a collaborative recommendation is to identify the most suitable set of users to drive the selection of the items to be offered in each case. To distinguish relevant and reliable users from unreliable ones, trust and reputation models are being increasingly incorporated in these systems, by using network structures in which nodes represent users and edges represent trust statements. However, current approaches require the users to provide explicit data (about which other users they trust or not) to form such networks. In this chapter, we apply a semantic approach to automatically build implicit trust networks and, thereby, improve the recommendation results transparently to the users. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract = {Along with an increasing sophistication of products, services and contents migrating to the digital space, the Social Web has revolutionized the architecture of social relationships. In a social networking environment, the traditional legal analysis is challenged by new behavioral patterns likely to evoke certain privacy concerns. On the one hand, users are actively involved in the provision of relevant information intended to fuel personalization strategies and recommender systems. Therefore, the recommending activity becomes decentralized and users go from passive observer to active recommendation provider. On the other hand, the intense participation in social networks represents an infinite source of valuable information. Since like-minded individuals assemble and share interests and preferences, regular and repetitive social patterns in searching, browsing, selecting or buying offer a wealth of (shared) data about users and represent a valuable source of information. Both assumptions, linked to the Social Web, call for exploring the need to redefine the legal approach to recommender systems under new coordinates. This paper aims to examine the development of recommender systems, considering the new patterns of social behavior, and tackle the emerging legal concerns aroused by the collection and process of personal and social information and the legal consequences of devising a decentralized recommendation model. As a conclusion, a model likely to achieve a balance between privacy risks and personalization advantages is proposed. Service providers are encouraged to devise technical and organizational measures intended to minimize data collection and guarantee a free and well-informed user consent giving by implementing opt-out mechanisms and deploying ambitious transparency and disclosure policies, enabling individuals to build their digital ego on a sound consent-directed basis. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely adopted recommender methods, whereas it is suffering the issue of sparse rating data that will severely degenerate the quality of recommendations. To address this issue, the article proposes a novel method, named the FTRA (Fusing Trust and Ratings), trying to improve the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation by means of elaborately integrating twofold sparse information, i.e., the conventional rating data given by users and the social trust network among the same users. The performance of FTRA is rigorously validated by comparing it with six representative methods on a real-world dataset. The experimental results show that the FTRA outperforms all other competitors in terms of both precision and recall. More importantly, our work suggests that the strategy of augmenting sparse rating data by fusing trust networks does significantly improve the quality of conventional collaborative filtering recommendation, and its quality could be further improved by means of designing more effective integrating schemes. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Hence, appropriate recommendation mechanisms are needed to help them to select the optimal services in the set of cloud services with identical or similar functionality. In this paper, we propose a Trust-based Recommendation System in service-oriented Cloud computing(TRSC). We first present the architecture of TRSC which measures cloud services based on the trust of them. In TRSC, the trust value is the combination of direct trust and recommendation trust. Direct trust of a cloud service user A on a cloud service C is computed basing on the direct interaction of A with C. And the evaluation method for calculating recommendation trust is based on the interaction of cloud service users Bs with C where Bs are users who are trusted by A, correlative with A or authorities of the field. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach can get a better recommendation accuracy than traditional collaborative filtering. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a new recommendation scheme that combines case-based reasoning (CBR) with collaborative filtering (CF) and incorporates fuzzy trust model. The CBR methodology is employed to find the most appropriate cluster that forms neighborhood (nbd) set for the active user. The nbd generation process of CBR, based on user rating vector (URV) and clustering, improves system's scalability to certain extent. Additionally, the proposed scheme allows users to decide which other user's opinions they should trust more. In this way, the trustworthy users from the set of neighbors suggested by CBR are filtered by applying a fuzzy trust model. As a consequence, only trustworthy neighbors contribute to the final prediction. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed recommendation scheme (Trust/CBR/CF) outperforms Pearson CF (PCF) and CBR/CF. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

TABRS combines hybrid recommender system with automated argumentation between agents. The system also improves recommendation repair activity by discovering interesting alternatives based on user's underlying mental attitudes.

Collaborative filtering recommender systems suggest the items based on the item ratings provided by similar users in the network. Trust-based recommender systems utilize an explicitly issued trust between users to increase the accuracy of the recommendations. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired algorithm, called Trust-based Ant Recommender (T-BAR), to further increase the accuracy and the coverage of the recommendations in trust-based networks. T-BAR uses the Ant Colony System computational model to imitate the behavior of ants during their search for a good food source. T-BAR's advantage over other known algorithms is that it considers all the target item ratings along the paths rather than just using the ratings found at the end of each path. The Epinions.com dataset was used for the empirical evaluation of Trust-based Ant Recommender and proved its success by drastically improving the coverage of the recommendations while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy of the results. T-BAR outperforms the basic CF algorithm that uses the Pearson Similarity and Massa's MoleTrust (MT) by achieving a balanced trade-off between accuracy and coverage. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Most approaches in this regard estimates trust base on global user profile similarity or history of exchanged opinions.

SNRS are implemented to take advantage of the acquaintance relationships, which form the essential links within social networks, to enable people in need of item purchasing recommendations to send requests for recommendations and receive recommendations from people throughout the network. Each person in the social network maintains a pair of trust and distrust ratings for each of their acquaintances and updates the ratings based on usefulness of received from the corresponding acquaintance. A pair of trust and distrust rating is used instead of just a single trust rating where the assumed distrust rating can be derived from the trust rating. In the proposed trust and distrust mechanism, trust represents the perceived risk of choosing a recommendation from the corresponding acquaintance while distrust is a protective measure indicating the level of doubt on the level of trust that is assigned to the same acquaintance. The proposed mechanism corresponds to studies indicating that the trust and distrust are determined separately, with the level of trust being based on a relatively rational evaluation while the level of distrust is based more on fear and other irrational emotions. When the level of distrust rises over a certain threshold for an acquaintance, recommendations received from the acquaintance will not be considered during the decision making process until the level of distrust falls below the threshold. The simulation used for this study utilizes software agents that are connected with one another via a social network to model the behavior of people when soliciting recommendations and providing recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2012 NiCT.},

Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The article explores stability as a new measure of recommender systems performance. Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithm's own predictions to the algorithm's training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease users' trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce users' acceptance of recommendations. In this article, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of many important factors (e.g., the sparsity of original rating data, normalization of input data, the number of new incoming ratings, the distribution of incoming ratings, the distribution of evaluation data, etc.) and report the impact they have on recommendation stability. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

However, CF is unable to produce high quality recommendations when user rating data is lacking or insufficient. To address this "sparsity" problem of CF systems, this paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system. The proposed system improves recommendation quality by exploiting trust scores between users in a social network.

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are a prominent solution to the problem of information overload on the web. It is impossible for users to process or even understand all information presented to them. Also, it becomes more and more difficult for an individual to identify appropriate concrete pieces of information or information sources. RSs aim at adapting the presented content and the order in which it is presented to users- individual needs, based on their preferences and past behavior. Yet, a system can only provide accurate recommendations if it has been authentically used before, i.e., been able to collect information about a user. As authentic usage depends on a user-s acceptance, the success of RSs in general is strongly dependent on acceptance also. If recommendations seem inappropriate, the trust in the system will fade. This paper presents a study analyzing how and to what extent different factors like transparency or controllability influence acceptance in the context of web-based recommendation.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have been used in various application domains to solve the information-overload problem. Recently, trust-based recommender systems have incorporated the trustworthiness of users into CF techniques to improve the quality of recommendation. Some researchers have proposed rating-based trust models to derive the trust values based on users' past ratings of items, or based on explicitly specified relations (e.g. friends) or trust relationships. The rating-based trust model may not be effective in CF recommendations, due to unreliable trust values derived from very few past rating records. In this work, we propose a hybrid personal trust model which adaptively combines the rating-based trust model and explicit trust metric to resolve the drawback caused by insufficient past rating records. Moreover, users with similar preferences usually form a group to share items (knowledge) with each other, and thus users' preferences may be affected by group members. Accordingly, group trust can enhance personal trust to support recommendation from the group perspective. Eventually, we propose a recommendation method based on a hybrid model of personal and group trust to improve recommendation performance. The experiment result shows that the proposed models can improve the prediction accuracy of other trust-based recommender systems.},

Such explanations can serve seven aims: effectiveness, satisfaction, transparency, scrutability, trust, persuasiveness, and efficiency. These aims can be incompatible, so any evaluation needs to state which aim is being investigated and use appropriate metrics. This paper focuses particularly on effectiveness (helping users to make good decisions) and its trade-off with satisfaction. It provides an overview of existing work on evaluating effectiveness and the metrics used. It also highlights the limitations of the existing effectiveness metrics, in particular the effects of under- and overestimation and recommendation domain. In addition to this methodological contribution, the paper presents four empirical studies in two domains: movies and cameras. These studies investigate the impact of personalizing simple feature- based explanations on effectiveness and satisfaction. Both approximated and real effectiveness is investigated. Contrary to expectation, personalization was detrimental to effectiveness, though it may improve user satisfaction. The studies also highlighted the importance of considering opt-out rates and the underlying rating distribution when evaluating effectiveness. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

abstract = {One fundamental requirement of the trust-aware recommender system (TARS) is to efficiently find as many recommenders as possible for the active users. Existing approaches of TARS choose to search the entire trust network, which have very high computational cost. Though the trust network is the scale-free network, we show via experiments that TARS cannot find satisfactory number of recommenders by directly applying the classical searching mechanism of the scale-free network. This is because it chooses the local highest-degree node at each step of the trust propagation. Since the power of the trust network's degree distribution is not big enough, the selected nodes cannot cover superior number of users. In this paper, we propose an efficient searching mechanism, named S-Searching, for TARS based on the scale-freeness of trust networks: choosing the global highest-degree nodes to construct a Skeleton, and searching the recommenders via this Skeleton. Benefiting from the superior outdegrees of the nodes in the Skeleton, S-Searching can find the recommenders very efficiently. Experimental results show that S-Searching can find almost the same number of recommenders as that of conducting full search, which is much more than that of applying the classical searching mechanism in the scale-free network, while the computational complexity and cost is much less. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Most recent work on social network based recommendation is focused on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE). Social network based top-k recommendation, which recommends to a user a small number of items at a time, is not well studied. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on improving the accuracy of top-k recommendation using social networks. We first show that the existing social-trust enhanced Matrix Factorization (MF) models can be tailored for top-k recommendation by including observed and missing ratings in their training objective functions. We also propose a Nearest Neighbor (NN) based top-k recommendation method that combines users' neighborhoods in the trust network with their neighborhoods in the latent feature space. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that social networks can significantly improve the top-k hit ratio, especially for cold start users. Surprisingly, we also found that the technical approach for combining feedback data (e.g. ratings) with social network information that works best for minimizing RMSE works poorly for maximizing the hit ratio, and vice versa.

As to better serve users' activities across different domains, many online social networks now support a new feature of "Friends Circles", which refines the domain-oblivious "Friends" concept. RS should also benefit from domain-specific "Trust Circles". Intuitively, a user may trust different subsets of friends regarding different domains. Unfortunately, in most existing multi-category rating datasets, a user's social connections from all categories are mixed together. This paper presents an effort to develop circle-based RS. We focus on inferring category-specific social trust circles from available rating data combined with social network data. We outline several variants of weighting friends within circles based on their inferred expertise levels.

Such systems provide competitive advantage over other IPTV providers and improve the overall performance of the current systems by building up an overlay that increases content availability, prioritization and distribution that is based on users' interests. Current implementations are mostly centralized recommender service (CRS) where the information about the users' profiles is stored in a single server. This type of design poses a severe privacy hazard, since the users' profiles are fully under the control of the CRS and the users have to fully trust the CRS to keep their profiles private. In this paper, we present our approach to build a private centralized recommender service (PCRS) using collaborative filtering techniques and an agent based middleware for private recommendations (AMPR). The AMPR ensures user profile privacy in the recommendation process. We introduce two obfuscation algorithms embedded in the AMPR that protect users' profile privacy as well as preserve the aggregates in the dataset in order to maximize the usability of information for accurate recommendations. Using these algorithms provides the user complete control on the privacy of his personal profile. We also provide an IPTV network scenario that uses AMPR and its evaluations. {\textcopyright} 2012 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

This model exploits user's preferences (represented by both item ratings and trusting other users) to generate its recommendations. Intuitively, the performance of this model is influenced by the number of preferences the user expresses. In this work we focus on other characteristics of user's preferences than the number. Concerning item ratings, we touch on the rated items popularity, and the difference between the attributed rate and the item's average rate. Concerning trust relationships, we touch on the reputation of the trusted users. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {Collaborative recommender systems select potentially interesting items for each user based on the preferences of like-minded individuals. Particularly, e-commerce has become a major domain in these research field due to its business interest, since identifying the products the users may like or find useful can boost consumption. During the last years, a great number of works in the literature have focused in the improvement of these tools. Expertise, trust and reputation models are incorporated in collaborative recommender systems to increase their accuracy and reliability. However, current approaches require extra data from the users that is not often available. In this paper, we present two contributions that apply a semantic approach to improve recommendation results transparently to the users. On the one hand, we automatically build implicit trust networks in order to incorporate trust and reputation in the selection of the set of like-minded users that will drive the recommendation. On the other hand, we propose a measure of practical expertise by exploiting the data available in any e-commerce recommender system - the consumption histories of the users. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A recommender system is a Web technology that proactively suggests items of interest to users based on their objective behavior or explicitly stated preferences. Evaluations of recommender systems (RS) have traditionally focused on the performance of algorithms. However, many researchers have recently started investigating system effectiveness and evaluation criteria from users' perspectives. In this paper, we survey the state of the art of user experience research in RS by examining how researchers have evaluated design methods that augment RS's ability to help users find the information or product that they truly prefer, interact with ease with the system, and form trust with RS through system transparency, control and privacy preserving mechanisms finally, we examine how these system design features influence users' adoption of the technology. We summarize existing work concerning three crucial interaction activities between the user and the system: the initial preference elicitation process, the preference refinement process, and the presentation of the system's recommendation results. Additionally, we will also cover recent evaluation frameworks that measure a recommender system's overall perceptive qualities and how these qualities influence users' behavioral intentions. The key results are summarized in a set of design guidelines that can provide useful suggestions to scholars and practitioners concerning the design and development of effective recommender systems. The survey also lays groundwork for researchers to pursue future topics that have not been covered by existing methods. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

abstract = {With the enormous growth of the Internet and Agent-based E-commerce, online trust has become an increasingly important issue. The fact that multi-agent systems are vulnerable with respect to malicious agents poses a great challenge: the detection and the prevention of undesirable behaviors. That is the reason why techniques such as trust and reputation mechanisms have been used in literature. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy trust model for argumentation-based open multi-agent recommender systems. In an open Agent-based Recommender System, the goals of agents acting on behalf of their owners often conflict with each other. Therefore, a personal agent protecting the interest of a single user cannot always rely on them. Consequently, such a personal agent needs to determine whether to trust (information or services provided by) other agents or not. Lack of a trust computation mechanism may hinder the acceptance of agent-based technologies in sensitive applications where users need to rely on their personal agents. Against this background, we propose an extension of the basic argumentation framework in Agent-Based Recommender Systems to use the fuzzy trust within these models for trustworthy recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer India Pvt.

Because more and more large networks (even with millions of nodes) aim at leveraging trust, approaches to its assessment have to take into account the factors as efficient distributed implementation and effective security protection against malicious attacks.

It is produced in a distributed, open fashion by museums, libraries, archives, and media organizations, as well as individual persons. Managing publication of such richness and variety of content on theWeb, and at the same time supporting distributed, interoperable content creation processes, poses challenges where traditional publication approaches need to be re-Thought. Application of the principles and technologies of Linked Data and the SemanticWeb is a new, promising approach to address these problems. This development is leading to the creation of large national and international CH portals, such as Europeana, to large open data repositories, such as the Linked Open Data Cloud, and massive publications of linked library data in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Cultural Heritage has become one of the most successful application domains of Linked Data and SemanticWeb technologies. This book gives an overview on why, when, and how Linked (Open) Data and SemanticWeb technologies can be employed in practice in publishingCHcollections and other content on theWeb. The text first motivates and presents a general semantic portal model and publishing framework as a solution approach to distributed semantic content creation, based on an ontology infrastructure. On the SemanticWeb, such an infrastructure includes shared metadata models, ontologies, and logical reasoning, and is supported by shared ontology and otherWeb services alleviating the use of the new technology and linked data in legacy cataloging systems. The goal of all this is to provide layman users and researchers with new, more intelligent and usable Web applications that can be utilized by otherWeb applications, too, via well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (API). At the same time, it is possible to provide publishing organizations with more cost-efficient solutions for content creation and publication. This book is targeted to computer scientists,museum curators, librarians, archivists, and other CH professionals interested in Linked Data and CH applications on the Semantic Web. The text is focused on practice and applications, making it suitable to students, researchers, and practitioners developingWeb services and applications of CH, as well as to CH managers willing to understand the technical issues and challenges involved in linked data publication.},

abstract = {The trust-aware recommender system (TARS) is a newly proposed trust-aware application. It is able to solve the data sparseness problem of the conventional recommender systems. One of the basic research challenges in TARS is to find the recommenders efficiently. Existing works of TARS use the strategy of random walk to find the recommenders, which is obviously low efficiency. Though the trust network has been verified to be the scale-free network, due to the small power of its degree distributions, we have verified via experiments that the prediction coverage of TARS is very limited by applying the classical routing protocol of scale-free networks directly. We therefore propose a routing protocol for TARS, which is able to efficiently find reliable recommenders for the users of TARS. Our protocol is able to achieve much higher prediction coverage than the classical routing protocol of scale-free networks, while the computational complexity is greatly reduced comparing with existing works of TARS. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {With the explosion of Web 2.0 application such as blogs, social and professional networks, and various other types of social media, the rich online information and various new sources of knowledge flood users and hence pose a great challenge in terms of information overload. It is critical to use intelligent agent software systems to assist users in finding the right information from an abundance of Web data. Recommender systems can help users deal with information overload problem efficiently by suggesting items (e.g., information and products) that match users' personal interests. The recommender technology has been successfully employed in many applications such as recommending films, music, books, etc. The purpose of this report is to give an overview of existing technologies for building personalized recommender systems in social networking environment, to propose a research direction for addressing user profiling and cold start problems by exploiting user-generated content newly available in Web 2.0. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

Surprisingly, trust literature offers very little guidance for systematically integrating the vast amount of insights from behavioral research on trust into the development of computing systems. The aim of this article is to translate results from behavioral sciences into software requirement patterns that address user trust in recommender systems. Software requirement patterns are used in requirements engineering to recognize important and recurring issues and reduce the effort of compiling a list of software requirements. We collected antecedents that build trust, and developed software requirement patterns that demand functionality to support these antecedents.

Social recommendations for products refers to the fact that consumers trust a product more if there is a review (of any kind) for it, confirmed by many other users (in psychology this is known as Social Proof). Moreover, if the users that confirms it shares common 'tastes' with the consumer, not only that he/she will consider the product more reliable, but the 'good' will also match his preferences with a high probability and, therefore, he/she will prefer to buy the verified product.

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) help users search large amounts of digital contents and services by allowing them to identify the items that are likely to be more attractive or useful. RSs play an important persuasion role, as they can potentially augment the users trust towards in an application and orient their decisions or actions towards specific directions. This article explores the persuasiveness of RSs, presenting two vast empirical studies that address a number of research questions. First, we investigate if a design property of RSs, defined by the statistically measured quality of algorithms, is a reliable predictor of their potential for persuasion. This factor is measured in terms of perceived quality, defined by the overall satisfaction, as well as by how users judge the accuracy and novelty of recommendations. For our purposes, we designed an empirical study involving 210 subjects and implemented seven full-sized versions of a commercial RS, each one using the same interface and dataset (a subset of Netflix), but each with a different recommender algorithm. In each experimental configuration we computed the statistical quality (recall and F-measures) and collected data regarding the quality perceived by 30 users. The results show us that algorithmic attributes are less crucial than we might expect in determining the users perception of an RSs quality, and suggest that the users judgment and attitude towards a recommender are likely to be more affected by factors related to the user experience. Second, we explore the persuasiveness of RSs in the context of large interactive TV services. We report a study aimed at assessing whether measurable persuasion effects (e.g., changes of shopping behavior) can be achieved through the introduction of a recommender. Our data, collected for more than one year, allow us to conclude that, (1) the adoption of an RS can affect both the lift factor and the conversion rate, determining an increased volume of sales and influencing the users decision to actually buy one of the recommended products, (2) the introduction of an RS tends to diversify purchases and orient users towards less obvious choices (the long tail), and (3) the perceived novelty of recommendations is likely to be more influential than their perceived accuracy. Overall, the results of these studies improve our understanding of the persuasion phenomena induced by RSs, and have implications that can be of interest to academic scholars, designers, and adopters of this class of systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique has proven to be promising for implementing large scale recommender systems but its success depends mainly on locating similar neighbors. Due to data sparsity of the user-item rating matrix, the process of finding similar neighbors does not often succeed. In addition to this, it also suffers from the new user (cold start) problem as finding possible neighborhood and giving recommendations to user who has not rated any item or rated very few items is difficult. In this paper, our proposed Trust based Ant Recommender System (TARS) produces valuable recommendations by incorporating a notion of dynamic trust between users and selecting a small and best neighborhood based on biological metaphor of ant colonies. Along with the predicted ratings, displaying additional information for explanation of recommendations regarding the strength and level of connectedness in trust graph from where recommendations are generated, items and number of neighbors involved in predicting ratings can help active user make better decisions. Also, new users can highly benefit from pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms as positive feedback in the form of aggregated dynamic trust pheromone defines "popularity" of a user as recommender over a period of time. The performance of TARS is evaluated using two datasets of different sparsity levels viz. Jester dataset and MovieLens dataset (available online) and compared with traditional Collaborative Filtering based approach for generating recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal of the system is to identify and filter the recently published valuable resources while taking into account the interactions and the relationships the user has within social structures. The interactions are logged and aggregated in order to determine the trust scores between users. Using the scores obtained, one can identify the types of relationship established between users; the scores will then be integrated into an adaptive global model used for recommending resources. Our approach presents several advantages over classic CF-based approaches and content-based recommendations regarding cold start, scalability and serendipitous recommendations.

Such social rating systems are very convenient and offer alternative learning environments for decision makers, but they open the door for attackers to manipulate the social rating systems by selfishly promoting or maliciously demoting certain items. Although a fair amount of effort has been made to understand various risks and possible defense mechanisms to counter such attacks, most of the existing work to date has been devoted to studying specific types of attacks and their countermeasures. In this article, we argue that vulnerabilities in social rating systems and their countermeasures should be examined and analyzed in a systematic manner. We first give an overview of the common vulnerabilities and attacks observed in some popular social rating services. Next, we describe three types of attack strategies in two types of social rating systems, including a comprehensive theoretical analysis of their attack effectiveness and attack costs. Three context-aware countermeasures are then presented: (i) hiding user-item relationships, (ii) using confidence weight to distinguish popular and unpopular items, and (iii) incorporating time windows in trust establishment. We also provide an in-depth discussion on how these countermeasures can be used effectively to improve the robustness and trustworthiness of the social rating services. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

In this paper, we put forward that in addition to the traditional similarity in recommending the E- learning resources (like book, subjects, teachers), other factors such as experience and trust have an important role in generating effective recommendations. So, we considered both experience and trustworthiness of learners to develop a collaborative filtering framework, called CF-EXP-TR scheme, for e-learning recommendations. A two level filtering methodology is proposed which shows that recommendation of learning resources is taken by those learners who are more experienced as well as high trustworthy. The experimental results show that incorporation of experience and trust concepts into collaborative framework, CF-EXP-TR indeed improves the recommendation accuracy and establishes that our scheme is better than traditional Pearson based collaborative filtering, CF-PR. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

A variant of recommender systems that generates recommendations from a set of trusted people is recently getting more attention in social networks. However, people are concerned about their privacy as the information revealed in recommender systems, particularly in social networks, can be misused easily. A way to eliminate the privacy risks is to make the privacy-sensitive data inaccessible by means of encryption. While the private data is inaccessible to any outsiders and the server, the same functionality of the system can be achieved by processing the encrypted data. Unfortunately, the efficiency of processing encrypted data constitutes a big challenge. In this paper, we present a privacy-enhanced recommender system in a social trust network, which is designed to be highly efficient. The cryptographic protocol for generating recommendations is based on homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation techniques. The additional overhead with regard to computation and communication is minimized by packing data. The experimental results show that our proposal is promising to be deployed in real world. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper compares five different ways of interacting with an attribute-based recommender system and shows that different types of users prefer different interaction methods. In an online experiment with an energy-saving recommender system the interaction methods are compared in terms of perceived control, understandability, trust in the system, user interface satisfaction, system effectiveness and choice satisfaction. The comparison takes into account several user characteristics, namely domain knowledge, trusting propensity and persistence. The results show that most users (and particularly domain experts) are most satisfied with a hybrid recommender that combines implicit and explicit preference elicitation, but that novices and maximizers seem to benefit more from a non-personalized recommender that just displays the most popular items. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

We have set up an online user-centric based evaluation experiment to find a recommendation algorithm that improves user satisfaction for a popular Belgian cultural events website. Both implicit and explicit feedback in the form of user interactions with the website were logged over a period of 41 days, serving as the input for 5 popular recommendation approaches. By means of a questionnaire users were asked to rate di?erent qualitative aspects of the recommender system including accuracy, novelty, diversity, satisfaction, and trust. Results show that a hybrid of a user-based collaborative filtering and content-based approach outperforms the other algorithms on almost every qualitative metric. Correlation values between the answers in the questionnaire seem to indicate that both accuracy and transparency are correlated the most with general user satisfaction of the recommender system.},

In this article, we propose several recommendation algorithms that respect data privacy constraints in order to be implemented on decentralized and dynamic architecture. They do not need any global knowledge on the network, they limit data exchange to trusted friendship relations and protect private data from being spread over the network. We present an evaluation of different recommendation algorithms, in order to compare ours to centralized ones, such as those used in online marketing services. Several concerns are considered: specific accuracy measures are defined, as well as the amount of required knowledge on the overall dataset.

abstract = {Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users who have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model in a principled way. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users.},

abstract = {Modern in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) are able to provide a large amount of data to the driver. If every information which might be of interest is delivered directly to the driver, information overload becomes a serious problem. Recommender systems are a promising approach to reduce information overload but they are mainly designed for desktop systems or mobile devices. In-vehicle recommender systems have to cope with interaction restrictions and limited cognitive resources of the driver. Therefore, we investigate proactive recommender systems, where recommendations are pushed automatically. The contribution of this paper is a user study in a real world setup to investigate the acceptance of a proactive recommender system while driving. The evaluation is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). As perceived ease of use is crucial for acceptance, we design an in-vehicle user interface for proactive recommendations. Our results show that our proactive recommender is perceived as helpful and assisting and is not obtrusive and distracting while driving. We also found that clear information delivery and trust is crucial for the acceptance of in-vehicle recommendations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Cold start recommendations are important because they help build user loyalty, which is the key to the success of e-services and e-commerce systems. Recommending useful information for new users generally creates a sense of belonging and loyalty, and encourages them to visit e-commerce systems frequently. However, as new users take time to become familiar with recommendation systems, the systems usually have limited information about newcomers and have difficulty providing appropriate recommendations. The cold start phenomenon has a serious impact on the performance of recommendation systems. To address the problem, we propose a cold start recommendation method that integrates a web of trust with a user model to identify trustworthy users. The suggestions of those users are then aggregated to provide useful recommendations for cold start users. Experiments based on the well-known Epinions dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient, and outperforms well-known recommendation methods by a significant margin.},

As Galleries, Libraries, Archiving institutions and Museums (GLAM) created digital representations of their masterpieces new concerns arise regarding the longterm accessibility of digitized and digitally born content. Repository managers of institutions need to take well documented decisions with regard to which digital object representations to use for archiving or long term access to their valuable collections. The digital preservation recommender system presented within this paper aims at reducing the complexity in the process of decision making by providing support for classification and the preservation risk analysis of digital objects. Technical information which is available as linked data in open knowledge sources facilitates the construction of the DiPRec's recommender knowledge base. This paper presents the DiPRec recommender system, a community approach on how to achieve the generation of well founded and trusted recommendations through open linked data and inferred knowledge in the domain of long-term information preservation for GLAM institutions.},

It highlights two of the key issues facing recommender systems design in the library domain: 1) Trust: users' trust both in the system itself and in collaboratively generated suggestions; and 2) Context: the difficulties of a system adapting to the huge range of information-seeking contexts that accompany a diverse user base. The paper describes how future qualitative and quantitative research will attempt to address these issues, and produce a system that best serves users of WorldCat.org. It is hoped that as well as contributing to recommender systems research in general, the results of this project will help inform debates relating to the interaction between users and systems in a library context.

Matrix completion finds applications in recommender systems. In this setting, the rows of the matrix may correspond to items and the columns may correspond to users. The known entries are the ratings given by users to some items. The aim is to predict the unobserved ratings. This problem is commonly stated in a constrained optimization framework. We follow an approach that exploits the geometry of the low-rank constraint to recast the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold. We then apply first-and second-order Riemannian trust-region methods to solve it. The cost of each iteration is linear in the number of known entries. Our methods, RTRMC 1 and 2, outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of problem instances.},

abstract = {Information recommender system is considered to be one of the most effective tools to solve the problem of information overload. Collaborative Filtering (CF), which utilizes similar neighbors to generate recommendations, is believed to be the most widely implemented and most mature technique for recommender systems. However, the recommendation results are often unsatisfactory due to the data sparsity of the input ratings matrix. Consequently, a hybrid recommender system which combines social network, trust network, and improved CF is proposed to enhance the accuracy of recommendation and overcome the weakness of data sparsity. Another advantage of the system is that utilizing the community structure discovered in social network as a new trust network sharply reduces the computation required for traditional CF. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that the hybrid recommender system which incorporates social network and trust network into improved CF is more effective in terms of accuracy. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Furthermore, it helps the trust model to bootstrap by providing an estimation of trust value based on similar situations or similar trustees previously observed. The rules are automatically extracted from the history and encoded as conditions connecting contextual information to trust judgments. Through the use of subjective logic, this method explicitly incorporates uncertainty, thereby making it suitable in situations of partial ignorance and imperfect information. Although our method is suggested for trust and reputation systems, it may also be applied for any other system that uses ratings such as recommender systems. We give an example of implementation of our proposal for a large-scale real dataset. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

We run an experiment in the movie recommendation domain where we use a personality test to identify the group leaders and test the number of people they are able to convince about a certain item to consume. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the age of information explosion, Internet facilitates product searching and collecting much more convenient for users. However, it is time-consuming and exhausting for users to deal with large amounts of product information. In response, various recommendation approaches have been developed to recommend products that match users' preferences and requirements. In addition to the well-known collaborative filtering recommendation approach, the trust-based recommendation approach is the emerging one. The reason is that most of online communities allow users to express their trust on other users. Based on the analysis of trust relationships, the trust-based recommendation approach finds out and consults the opinions of more reliable users and therefore makes better recommendations. Existing trust-based recommendation techniques consider all trust relationships in a given trust network equally important and give them the same trust strength. However, in a real-world setting, trust relationships may be of various strengths. In response, in this study, we propose a mechanism for trust strength estimation on the basis of the machine learning approach and estimate the trust strength for each existing trust relationship in a given trust network. To overcome the sparsity of the trust network, we also develop a modified trust propagation method to expand the original trust network. Finally, we perform a series of experiments to demonstrate the performance of our trust-based recommendation approach based on the trust strength estimation mechanism. Our empirical evaluation results show that our proposed approach outperforms our benchmark techniques, i.e., the traditional collaborative filtering approach and the original trustbased one.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are highly sensitive to cases of false-positives, that is, recommendations made which have proved not to be relevant. These situations often lead to a loss of trust in the system by the users; therefore, every improvement in the recommendation quality measures is important. Recommender systems which admit an extensive set of values in the votes (usually those which admit more than 5 stars to rate an item) cannot be assessed adequately using precision as a recommendation quality measure; this is due to the fact that the division of the possible values of the votes into just two sets, relevant (true-positive) and not-relevant (false-positive), proves to be too poor and involves the accumulation of values in the not-relevant set. In order to establish a balanced quality measure it is necessary to have access to detailed information on how the cases of false-positives are distributed. This paper provides the mathematical formalism which defines the precision quality measure in recommender systems and its generalization to extended-precision. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

However, in a large social network where most people would have hundreds of acquaintances and millions of people within the social network, relying solely on the recommendations obtained through a search that involves a significant number of people within a network, which may not be the most practical and economical option. A solution to this is to limit the number of people between two people within a social network, between the person soliciting a recommendation and a person potentially providing a recommendation. To compensate for the potential loss of recommendations as a result of the limit, a mechanism to compliment the recommendation system, known as expert groups, is created. Expert groups are a collection of people with a common expertise in a common knowledge area and a certain degree of like-mindedness. People within these expert groups can provide recommendations on issues within the common knowledge area. The proposed framework uses software agents to model the behavior of people when soliciting recommendations and providing recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Although, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most successful and widely implemented filtering, data sparsity is still a major concern. In this work, we have proposed a fuzzy trust propagation scheme to alleviate the sparsity problem. Since trust is often a gradual trend, so trust to a person can be expressed more naturally using linguistic expressions. In this work, fuzzy trust is represented by linguistic terms rather than numerical values. We discuss the basic trust concepts such as fuzzy trust modeling, propagation and aggregation operators. An empirical evaluation of the proposed scheme on well known Movie-Lens dataset shows that fuzzy trust propagation allows reducing the sparsity problem of RSs while preserving the quality of recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The majority of trust models consider two types of knowledge in estimating the trustworthiness of a trustee in an interaction: experiences and recommendations. However, this leads to a nested trust problem; how could we trust the recommendations? Even when the recommenders are not deceptive, there is still a trust related problem due to the subjectivity of human judgment. This paper describes a missing part of the existing trust management models: handling the subjectivity of recommendations. Our approach is based on the idea that a recommender's judgment method can be inferred and the recommended entity can be (re)evaluated according to the value system of the truster who is about to make a decision. Extraction of the judgment method involves abductive reasoning which is implemented in the proposed account using subjective logic. This approach has been quantitatively compared with two other methods. Our experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms an extended version of the "Beta trust model", a trust model without subjectivity elimination. Our suggested method for trust and reputation systems may also be applied to other systems that include a rating mechanism such as recommender systems.},

It aims at improving the quality of the information exchanged among agents because communication will occur primarily with trusted sources in the hope to decrease the communication load. Also, agents become experts in specific types of recommendation.

Online social networks such as Facebook provide users with the ability to maintain an unprecedented number of social connections. Recommendation systems exploit the opinions of other users to suggest movies or products based on our similarity with them. This shift from machines to users motivates the emergence of novel applications and research challenges. In this paper, we embrace the social aspects of the Web 2.0 by considering a novel problem. We build a distributed social market that combines interest-based social networks with explicit networks like Facebook. Our Social Market (SM) allows users to identify and build connections to other users that can provide interesting goods, or information. At the same time, it backs up these connections with trust, by associating them with paths of trusted users that connect new acquaintances through the explicit network. This convergence of implicit and explicit networks yields TAPS, a novel gossip protocol that can be applied in applications devoted to commercial transactions, or to add robustness to standard gossip applications like dissemination or recommendation systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Content-centric social Web sites, such as discussion forums and blog sites, have flourished during the past several years. These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., preferences and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle these above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users' content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. For a given time interval, each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most popular latent communities at different time intervals, Pharos creates a time-sensitive, visual social map of a Web site. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate the content in which they are interested or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfections in the recommendation algorithms. We have developed several Pharos applications, one of which is deployed within our company. Our preliminary evaluation of the deployed application shows the usefulness of Pharos. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

To test the existence of a causal link between social presence and reuse intention, and the mediating role of trust between these two variables, this study conducted experiments varying the level of social presence while providing personalized recommendations to users based on their explicit preferences. This study also compared these effects in two different product contexts: hedonic and utilitarian. The results show that greater social presence increases both reuse intention and trust in the recommender systems.

However, it is normally difficult for a user to justify whether it is safe and proper to disclose personal data to others in different contexts. For solving this problem, we propose AdPriRec, a context-aware recommender system for preserving user privacy in MANET services. To support frequent changes of node pseudonyms in MANET, we develop a hybrid recommendation generation solution. We apply a trusted recommendation sever who knows the node's real identity to calculate a recommendation vector based on long term historical experiences. The vector can be also generated at each MANET node according to recent experiences accumulated based on node pseudonyms, while this vector could be further fine-tuned when the recommendation server is accessible. We design a number of algorithms for AdPriRec to generate context-aware recommendations for MANET users. The recommendation vector is calculated based on a number of factors such as data sharing behaviors and behavior correlation, service popularity and context, personal data type, community information of nodes and trust value of each involved party. An example based evaluation illustrates the usage and implication of the factors and shows AdPriRec's effectiveness. A prototype implementation based on Nokia N900 further proves the concept of AdPriRec design. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have emerged in various applications to support item recommendation, which solve the information-overload problem by suggesting items of interest to users. Recently, trust-based recommender systems have incorporated the trustworthiness of users into CF techniques to improve the quality of recommendation. They propose trust computation models to derive the trust values based on users past ratings on items. A user is more trustworthy if s/he has contributed more accurate predictions than other users. Nevertheless, conventional trust-based CF methods do not address the issue of deriving the trust values based on users various information needs on items over time. In knowledge-intensive environments, users usually have various information needs in accessing required documents over time, which forms a sequence of documents ordered according to their access time. We propose a sequence-based trust model to derive the trust values based on users sequences of ratings on documents. The model considers two factors time factor and document similarity in computing the trustworthiness of users. The proposed model enhanced with the similarity of user profiles is incorporated into a standard collaborative filtering method to discover trustworthy neighbors for making predictions.

abstract = {A book recommender system is very useful for a digital library. Good book recommender systems can effectively help users find interesting and relevant books from the massive resources, by providing individual recommendation book list for each end-user. By now, a variety of collaborative filtering algorithms have been invented, which are the cores of most recommender systems. However, because of the explosion of information, especially in the Internet, the improvement of the efficiency of the collaborative filting (CF) algorithm becomes more and more important. In this paper, we first propose a parallel Top-N recommendation algorithm in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) which combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach to deal with the cold-start user problem. Then based on this algorithm, we present a parallel book recommender system on a GPU (Graphics Processor unit) for CADAL digital library platform. Our experimental results show our algorithm is very efficient to process the large-scale datasets with good accuracy, and we report the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Recent statistics show that the number of online shoppers are increasing where the majority of them use online recommendation systems for product/service reviews. Although online reviews are becoming increasingly important, consumers face two major challenges of usability and robustness when they make purchase decisions based on the available reviews. More specifically, usability issues arise when consumers need to be able to extract relevant information given a high volume of data with uncertainty due to high variance. For robustness, judging the degree of truthfulness of the available recommendations can be a daunting task for consumers. In this paper, we propose a post-purchase tracking system as an enhancement to current online recommendation systems by embracing a peer review process and ask each consumer to score the reviews that previous consumers have posted. Furthermore, we propose to visualize the peer review processes such that people find the recommendation systems more efficient and useful to learn information. Our preliminary user study results indicate that our post-purchase tracking system is a promising approach that can help online consumers determine what information to trust with high confidence. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems are information systems that attempt to recommend items of interest to particular users based on their explicit and implicit preferences. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims at assisting the decision maker in the decision making process, or giving the decision maker a recommendation, concerning a set of actions, alternatives, items etc. Thus, despite their differences, Recommender Systems and Multi-Criteria Decision Making share the same objective which is supporting the decision making process and reducing information overload. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid Multi-Criteria Trust-enhanced CF (MC-TeCF) approach. The proposed MC-TeCF approach combines the MC user-based CF and the MC user-based Trust filtering approaches to alleviate the standard Single-Criteria user-based CF limitations. Empirical results demonstrate the significance and effectiveness of the proposed MC-TeCF approach in terms of improving accuracy, as well as in dealing with very sparse data sets or cold start users compared with the standard Single-Criteria user-based CF approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

We analyze Taobao, a Chinese consumer marketplace that is the world's largest e-commerce website. What sets Taobao apart from its competitors is its integrated instant messaging tool, which buyers can use to ask sellers about products or ask other buyers for advice. In our study, we focus on how an individual's commercial transactions are embedded in their social graphs. By studying triads and the directed closure process, we quantify the presence of information passing and gain insights into when different types of links form in the network. Using seller ratings and review information, we then quantify a price of trust. How much will a consumer pay for transaction with a trusted seller? We conclude by modeling this consumer choice problem: if a buyer wishes to purchase a particular product, how does (s)he decide which store to purchase it from? By analyzing the performance of various feature sets in an information retrieval setting, we demonstrate how the social graph factors into understanding consumer behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

However, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real-world observations where we always turn to our trusted friends for recommendations. Aiming at modeling recom- mender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. The proposed framework is quite general, and it can also be applied to pure user-item rating matrix even if we do not have explicit social trust information among users. In this framework, we coin the term social trust ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright}2011 ACM.},

abstract = {The system described herein represents the first example of a recommender system in digital ecosystems where agents negotiate services on behalf of small companies. The small companies compete not only with price or quality but also with a wider service-by-service composition by subcontracting with other companies. The final result of these offerings depends on negotiations at the scale of millions of small companies. This scale requires new platforms for supporting digital business ecosystems (DBEs), as well as related services like open-id, trust management, monitors, and recommenders. This is done in the Open Negotiation Environment (ONE), which is an open-source platform that allows agents, on behalf of small companies, to negotiate and use the ecosystem services, and enables the development of new agent technologies. The methods and tools of cyber engineering are necessary to build up ONEs that are stable, a basic condition for predictable and reliable business environments. Aiming to build stable DBEs by means of improved collective intelligence, we introduce a model of negotiation-style dynamics from the point of view of computational ecology. This model inspires an ecosystem monitor and a novel negotiation-style recommender (NSR). The ecosystem monitor provides hints to the NSR to achieve greater stability of ONE in a DBE. The greater stability provides the small companies with higher predictability and, therefore, better business results. The NSR is implemented with a simulated-annealing algorithm at a constant temperature, and its impact is shown by applying it to a real case of ONE populated by Italian companies. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {In social tagging systems, users have different purposes when they annotate items. Tags not only depict the content of the annotated items, for example by listing the objects that appear in a photo, or express contextual information about the items, for example by providing the location or the time in which a photo was taken, but also describe subjective qualities and opinions about the items, or can be related to organisational aspects, such as self-references and personal tasks. Current folksonomy-based search and recommendation models exploit the social tag space as a whole to retrieve those items relevant to a tag-based query or user profile, and do not take into consideration the purposes of tags. We hypothesise that a significant percentage of tags are noisy for content retrieval, and believe that the distinction of the personal intentions underlying the tags may be beneficial to improve the accuracy of search and recommendation processes. We present a mechanism to automatically filter and classify raw tags in a set of purpose-oriented categories. Our approach finds the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. The obtained concepts are then transformed into semantic classes that can be uniquely assigned to content- and context-based categories. The identification of subjective and organisational tags is based on natural language processing heuristics. We collected a representative dataset from Flickr social tagging system, and conducted an empirical study to categorise real tagging data, and evaluate whether the resultant tags categories really benefit a recommendation model using the Random Walk with Restarts method. The results show that content- and context-based tags are considered superior to subjective and organisational tags, achieving equivalent performance to using the whole tag space. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The majority of recommender systems predict user preferences by relating users with similar attributes or taste. Prior research has shown that trust networks improve the accuracy of recommender systems, predominantly using algorithms devised by individual researchers. In this work, omitting any specific trust inference algorithm, we investigate how useful it might be if explicit trust relationships are used to select the best neighbors or predictors, to generate accurate recommendations. We conducted a series of evaluations using data from Epinions.com, a popular collaborative reviewing system. We find that, for highly active users, using trusted sources as predictors does not give more accurate recommendations compared to the classic similarity-based collaborative filtering scheme, except in improving the precision to recommend items that are of users' liking. This cautions against the intuition that inputs from trusted sources would always be more accurate or helpful. The use of explicit trust links, however, provides a slight gain in prediction accuracy when it comes to the less active users. These findings highlight the need and potential to adapt the use of trust information for different groups of users, besides to better understand trust when employing it in the recommender systems. Parallel to the trust criterion, we also investigated the effects of requiring the candidate predictors to have an equal or higher experience level.},

The human-robot interaction takes place in natural language in the form of a dialogue session during which the robot describes exhibits, but also recommends exhibits that might be of interest to the visitors. It is also possible for the robot to explain its reasoning to the visitors, with a view to increasing transparency and consequently trust in the robot's suggestions. Furthermore, the robot leads the visitors to the location of the desired exhibit. The framework is general enough to be implemented in different hardware, including portable computational devices. The framework is based on a cognitive model comprised of four modules: a reactive, a deliberative, a reflective and an affective one.

abstract = {Some popular product review sites such as Epinions allow users to establish a trust network among themselves, indicating who they trust in providing product reviews and ratings. While trust relations have been found to be useful in generating personalised recommendations, the relations between trust and product ratings has so far been overlooked. In this paper, we examine large dataseis collected from Epinions and Ciao, two popular product review sites. We discover that in general users who trust each other tend to have smaller differences in their ratings as time passes, giving support to the theories of homophily and social influence. However, we also discover that this does not hold true across all trusted users. A trust relation does not guarantee that two users have similar preferences, implying that personalised recommendations based on trust relations do not necessarily produce more accurate predictions. We propose a method to estimate the strengths of trust relations so as to estimate the true influence among the trusted users. Our method extends the popular matrix factorisation technique for collaborative filtering, which allow us to generate more accurate rating predictions at the same time. We also show that the estimated strengths of trust relations correlate with the similarity among the users. Our work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between trust relations and product ratings, and suggests that trust networks may serve as a more general socialising venue than only an indication of similarity in user preferences.

Trust and reputation are being increasingly incorporated in collaborative recommender systems in order to improve their accuracy and reliability, using network structures in which nodes represent users and edges represent trust statements. However, current approaches require the users to provide explicit data (about which other users they trust or not) to form such networks.

Stability is a desired property of recommender systems and has important implications on users' trust and acceptance of recommendations. Prior research has reported that some popular recommendation algorithms suffer from high degree of instability. In this study we propose a novel meta-algorithm that can be used in conjunction with different traditional recommendation techniques to improve their stability. Our experimental results on real-world movie rating data demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve substantially higher stability as compared to the original recommendation algorithms, while, perhaps as importantly, providing additional improvements in predictive accuracy as well.},

In general, we define a recommendation algorithm to be "stable" if its predictions for the same items are consistent over a period of time, assuming that any new ratings that have been submitted to the recommender system over the same period of time are in complete agreement with system's prior predictions. In this paper, we advocate that stability should be a desired property of recommendation algorithms, because unstable recommendations can lead to user confusion and, therefore, reduce trust in recommender systems. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate stability of several popular recommendation algorithms. Our results suggest that modelbased recommendation techniques demonstrate higher stability than memory-based collaborative filtering heuristics. We also find that the stability measure for recommendation techniques is influenced by many factors, including the sparsity of the initial rating data, the number of new incoming ratings (representing the length of the time period over which the stability is being measured), the distribution of the newly added rating values, and the rating normalization procedures employed by the recommendation algorithms.

While most recommender research focuses on improving the accuracy of recommender algorithms, this paper stresses the role of explanations for recommended items for gaining acceptance and trust. Specifically, we present a method which is capable of providing detailed explanations of recommendations while exhibiting reasonable prediction accuracy. The method models the users' ratings as a function of their utility part-worths for those item attributes which influence the users' evaluation behavior, with part-worth being estimated through a set of auxiliary regressions and constrained optimization of their results. We provide evidence that under certain conditions the proposed method is superior to established recommender approaches not only regarding its ability to provide detailed explanations but also in terms of prediction accuracy. We further show that a hybrid recommendation algorithm can rely on the content-based component for a majority of the users, switching to collaborative recommendation only for about one third of the user base.

abstract = {The Wikipedia is a web-based encyclopedia, written and edited collaboratively by Internet users. The Wikipedia has an extremely open editorial policy that allows anybody, to create or modify articles. This has promoted a broad and detailed coverage of subjects, but also introduced problems relating to the quality of articles. The Wikipedia Recommender System (WRS) was developed to help users determine the credibility of articles based on feedback from other Wikipedia users. The WRS implements a collaborative filtering system with trust metrics, i.e., it provides a rating of articles which emphasizes feedback from recommenders that the user has agreed with in the past. This exposes the problem that most recommenders are not equally competent in all subject areas. The first WRS prototype did not include an evaluation of the areas of expertise of recommenders, so the trust metric used in the article ratings reflected the average competence of recommenders across all subject areas. We have now developed a new version of the WRS, which evaluates the expertise of recommenders within different subject areas. In order to do this, we need to identify a way to classify the subject area of all the articles in the Wikipedia. In this paper, we examine different ways to classify the subject area of Wikipedia article according to well established knowledge classification schemes. We identify a number of requirements that a classification scheme must meet in order to be useful in the context of the WRS and present an evaluation of four existing knowledge classification schemes with respect to these requirements. This evaluation helped us identify a classification scheme, which we have implemented in the current version of the Wikipedia Recommender System.},

abstract = {Evaluation have been an important subject since the early days of recommender systems. In online test, the clickthrough rate (CTR) is often adopted as the metric. However, recommended items with higher CTR does not imply higher relevance of two items since factors like item popularity or item serendipity may influence user's click behavior. We argue that the relevance of recommendation system is also desirable in many real applications. Here relevant means relevance in a human perceptible way. Relevant recommendations not only increase the users' trust to the system but are extremely useful for the vast number of anonymous user as their recommendations may only be made based on the current item. In this paper, we empirically examine the relation between the relevance of recommendations and the corresponding CTR with a few representative ItemCF algorithms through online data from a TV show/movie website, Hulu. Experiments show that algorithms with higher overall CTR may not correspond to higher relevance. Thus CTR may not be the optimal metric for online evaluation of recommender systems if producing relevant recommendations is of importance. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

We highlight six possible goals for explanations, resulting in overall satisfaction towards the system. We found that the most of the existing music recommenders of popular systems provide no explanations, or very limited ones. Since explanations are not independent of other UI elements in recommendation process, we consider how the other elements can be used to achieve the same goals. To this end, we evaluated several existing music recommenders. We wanted to discover which of the six goals (transparency, scrutability, effectiveness, persuasiveness, efficiency and trust) the different UI elements promote in the existing music recommenders, and how they could be measured in order to create a simple framework for evaluating recommender UIs. By using this framework designers of recommendation systems could promote users' trust and overall satisfaction towards a recommender system thereby improving the user experience with the system.},

abstract = {Content-centric social websites, such as discussion forums and blog sites, have flourished during the past several years. These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., p and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle the above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users' content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. Each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most "popular" latent communities, Pharos creates a visual social map of a website. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate their interested content or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfection in the recommendation algorithms. We have deployed Pharos within our company and our preliminary evaluation shows the usefulness of Pharos. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Then the combination algorithm for these two values is performed to generate the final searching output. Experimental results show that this model can provide more satisfactory searching results for users, and provides wonderful supports for friend searching and friend recommendation in OSN s. This model has been deployed in "Scene Life", a mobile social networking system of Nokia Research Center Beijing. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are one of the recent inventions to deal with ever growing information overload. Collaborative filtering seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems. With sufficient background information of item ratings, its performance is promising enough. But research shows that it performs very poor in a cold start situation where previous rating data is sparse. As an alternative, trust can be used for neighbor formation to generate automated recommendation. User assigned explicit trust rating such as how much they trust each other is used for this purpose. However, reliable explicit trust data is not always available. In this paper we propose a new method of developing trust networks based on user's interest similarity in the absence of explicit trust data. To identify the interest similarity, we have used user's personalized tagging information. This trust network can be used to find the neighbors to make automated recommendations. Our experiment result shows that the proposed trust based method outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering approach which uses users rating data. Its performance improves even further when we utilize trust propagation techniques to broaden the range of neighborhood. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In fact trust is also an important effective parameter in real life when people choose a choice from other friends. In this paper we suggest that the traditional emphasize on user similarity may be overstated and there are additional factors having an important role to play in guiding recommendations.

Over the past decade, the Wikipedia has experienced a dramatic growth in popularity and is considered by many the primary source of information on the Internet. The Wikipedia has an extremely open editorial policy that allows anybody, to create or modify articles. This has resulted in a broad and detailed coverage of subjects, but it has also caused problems relating to the quality of articles. The Wikipedia Recommender System (WRS) was developed to help human users determine the credibility of an article based on feedback from other Wikipedia users. The WRS calculates a personalised rating for any Wikipedia article based on feedback (recommendations) provided by other Wikipedia users. As part of this process, WRS users are expected to provide their own feedback about the quality of Wikipedia articles that they have read. This makes the WRS a rating-based collaborative filtering system, which implements trust metrics to determine the weight of feedback from different recommenders. In this paper the authors describe the WRS outlining some of the requirements and constraints that shaped the design of the system. The authors also provide a brief overview of the implementation of the WRS prototype. The WRS addresses the general problem of establishing trust in a collaboratively generated resource in a distributed multi-agent system, so the authors believe that the general architecture that underlies the WRS applies to many other applications in such systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract = {Given a user in a social network, which new friends should we recommend, the dual goal being to achieve user satisfaction and good network connectivity? Similarly, which new products are better to recommend to satisfy customers' taste/needs as well as increase vendor profit? Typical recommender systems use merely past purchases, product ratings, demographic meta-data, and network'proximity' to make recommendations. This traditional approach, however, does not take into account the profitability of products to vendors in a customer-product network, or the efficacy of new links in a social network. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as an optimization problem. In this paper, (a) we propose Value Pick, a framework which incorporates the'value' of recommendations into the system while still providing accurate recommendations that retain user trust; (b) our method is parsimonious (requires only a single parameter $\tau$), flexible ($\tau$ is used to flexibly adjust the level of balance between'user satisfaction' and'gain'), and general (can be used with any'value' metric); and finally (c) we examine the problem in the social networks setting, simulate comprehensive experiments to compare our method to several basic heuristics, and show that Value Pick yields higher'gain' while keeping user satisfaction high. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper I use philosophical accounts on the relationship between trust and knowledge in science to apprehend this relationship on the Web. I argue that trust and knowledge are fundamentally entangled in our epistemic practices. Yet despite this fundamental entanglement, we do not trust blindly. Instead we make use of knowledge to rationally place or withdraw trust. We use knowledge about the sources of epistemic content as well as general background knowledge to assess epistemic claims. Hence, although we may have a default to trust, we remain and should remain epistemically vigilant; we look out and need to look out for signs of insincerity and dishonesty in our attempts to know. A fundamental requirement for such vigilance is transparency: in order to critically assess epistemic agents, content and processes, we need to be able to access and address them. On the Web, this request for transparency becomes particularly pressing if (a) trust is placed in unknown human epistemic agents and (b) if it is placed in non-human agents, such as algorithms. I give examples of the entanglement between knowledge and trust on the Web and draw conclusions about the forms of transparency needed in such systems to support epistemically vigilant behaviour, which empowers users to become responsible and accountable knowers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Trust-aware recommender system (TARS) suggests the worthwhile information to the users on the basis of trust. Existing works of TARS suffers from the problem that they need extra user efforts to label the trust statements. The authors propose a novel model named iTARS to improve the existing TARS by using the implicit trust networks: instead of using the effort-consuming explicit trust, the easy available user similarity information is used to generate the implicit trusts for TARS. Further analysis shows that the implicit trust network has the small-world topology, which is independent of its dynamics. The rating prediction mechanism of iTARS is based on the small worldness of the implicit trust network: the authors set the maximum trust propagation distance of iTARS approximately equals the average path length of the trust network's corresponding random network. Experimental results show that with the same computational complexity, iTARS is able to improve the existing TARS works with higher rating prediction accuracy and slightly worse rating prediction coverage. {\textcopyright} 2010 {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract = {The growing popularity of Social Networks raises the important issue of trust. Among many systems which have realized the impact of trust, Recommender Systems have been the most influential ones. Collaborative Filtering Recommenders take advantage of trust relations between users for generating more accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a semantic recommendation framework for creating trust relationships among all types of users with respect to different types of items, which are accessed by unique URI across heterogeneous networks and environments. We gradually build up the trust relationships between users based on the rating information from user profiles and item profiles to generate trust networks of users. For analyzing the formation of trust networks, we employ T-index as an estimate of a user's trustworthiness to identify and select neighbors in an effective manner. In this work, we utilize T-index to form the list of an item's raters, called TopTrustee list for keeping the most reliable users who have already shown interest in the respective item. Thus, when a user rates an item, he/she is able to find users who can be trustworthy neighbors even though they might not be accessible within an upper bound of traversal path length. An empirical evaluation demonstrates how T-index improves the Trust Network structure by generating connections to more trustworthy users. We also show that exploiting T-index results in better prediction accuracy and coverage of recommendations collected along few edges that connect users on a Social Network. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract = {This paper describes a trust model for multiagent recommender systems. A user's request for a travel recommendation is decomposed by the system into subtasks, corresponding to travel services. Agents select tasks autonomously, and accomplish them using knowledge derived from previous solutions or with the help of other agents. Agents maintain local knowledge bases and, when requested to support a user in a travel planning task, they may collaborate exchanging information stored in their local bases. During this exchange process trusting other agents is fundamental. It helps agents to improve the quality of the recommendations and to avoid communication with unreliable agents. In the proposed model, the trust is also used to allow agents to become experts in particular subtasks, helping them to generate better recommendations. In this paper, we propose and validate a multiagent trust model showing the benefits of such model in a travel planning scenario. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders are subject to numerous shortcomings such as centralized processing, vulnerability to shilling attacks, and most important of all privacy. To overcome these obstacles, researchers proposed for utilization of interpersonal trust between users, to alleviate many of these crucial shortcomings. Till now, attention has been mainly paid to strong points about trust-aware recommenders such as alleviating profile sparsity or calculation cost efficiency, while least attention has been paid on investigating the notion of privacy surrounding the disclosure of individual ratings and most importantly protection of trust computation across social networks forming the backbone of these systems. To contribute to addressing problem of privacy in trust-aware recommenders, within this paper, first we introduce a framework for enabling privacy-preserving trust-aware recommendation generation. While trust mechanism aims at elevating recommender's accuracy, to preserve privacy, accuracy of the system needs to be decreased. Since within this context, privacy and accuracy are conflicting goals we show that a Pareto set can be found as an optimal setting for both privacy-preserving and trust-enabling mechanisms. We show that this Pareto set, when used as the configuration for measuring the accuracy of base collaborative filtering engine, yields an optimized tradeoff between conflicting goals of privacy and accuracy. We prove this concept along with applicability of our framework by experimenting with accuracy and privacy factors, and we show through experiment how such optimal set can be inferred. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Since higher ranked items are more likely selected and yield more revenues for their owners, providers of unpopular and low quality items have strong incentives to strategically manipulate their ranking. This paper analyzes the adversary cost for manipulating these rankings in a variety of scenarios. Particularly, we analyze and compare the adversarial cost to attack ranking systems that use various trust measures to detect and eliminate malicious ratings to systems that use no such a trust management mechanism. We provide theoretical results showing the relation between the capability of the trust mechanism in detecting malicious ratings and the minimal adversarial cost for successfully changing the ranking. Furthermore, we study the impact of sharing trust information between ranking systems to the adversarial cost. It is proved that sharing information between two ranking systems on common user identities and malicious behaviors detected can increase considerably the minimal adversarial cost to successfully attack the two systems under certain assumptions. The numerical evaluation of our results shows that the estimated adversary cost for manipulating the item ranking can be made significant when proper trust mechanisms are employed or combined.},

abstract = {With the exponential growth of Web contents, Recommender System has become indispensable for discovering new information that might interest Web users. Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches.

At the same time, social networks have become very popular with over a billion accounts shared across hundreds of networks. Social trust relationships, derived from social networks, are uniquely suited to speak to the quality of online information; recommender systems are designed to personalize, sort, aggregate, and highlight information. Merging social networks, trust, and recommender systems can improve the accuracy of recommendations and improve the user's experience.

With a prize of one million dollars one of the highest in computer science, it raised a tremendous awareness for as well as a transformation to the field of recommender systems. We are very happy to welcome you to the Third ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (ACM RecSys 2009) in New York. In the last few years, ACM RecSys has continuously grown and meanwhile certainly can be understood as the scientific core event in the area of recommender systems, bringing together persons from academic research, industry research as well as from applications. While recommender systems has close relations to many neighboring fields such as machine learning, information retrieval, databases, human computer interaction, e-commerce, semantic web and many others and many of the best conferences in these areas have their dedicated sessions on recommender systems, ACM RecSys is the conference where all of them finally meet. With 187 submissions this year's ACM RecSys has continued to grow at a fast rate of over 50%. Authors from 35 different countries from all over the world submitted their papers. After the program committee consisting of 78 researchers finished a thorough scientific review process in two rounds writing almost 700 reviews, less than 19% of the long submissions have been accepted, the overall acceptance rate for long and short papers is less than 40%. Besides a deepened interest in algorithms for recommender systems, this year tags and social networks, privacy and security and trust attracted the most attention by authors. Moreover, the program of ACM RecSys 2009 includes two keynotes, one from a more academic perspective and another one from a more industrial perspective, a panel session about the recently concluded Netflix challenge, three tutorials and three workshops as well as a doctoral symposium.},

By exploiting the concept of trust propagation over the trust network, trust-aware systems are able to make large number of accurate recommendations by utilizing the few trust statements given by the new user. In this paper, we propose intelligent strategies based on efficient heuristics, and examine existing strategies on the basis of which prospective trusted users are selected to be presented before a cold start user. Through experimental evaluation we show that selecting prospective trusted users based on our proposed efficient heuristics i.e. hybrid parameter preference score gives the most accurate recommendations. We also propose a clustering approach to select n users for the final list from the set of prospective users selected by a strategy. Furthermore, our paper also describes a new metric entropy0 to reduce the effort required by a cold start user to evaluate prospective trusted users.},

However, traditional algorithms focus only on user ratings and do not consider the changes of user interest and the credibility of ratings data, which affected the quality of the system's recommendation seriously. To solve this problem, this paper presents an improved algorithm. Firstly, the user's rating is given a weight by a gradual time decrease and credit assessment in the course of user similarity measurement, and then several users highly similar with active user are selected as his neighbor. Finally, the active user's preference for an item can be represented by the average scores of his neighbor. Experimental results show that the algorithm can make the neighbor recognition more accurately and enhance the quality of recommendation system effectively.},

In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties.

Even though the approach of using a web-of-trust scheme for assisting the recommendation production is well adopted, issues like the sparsity problem have not been explored adequately so far with regard to this. In this work we are proposing and testing a scheme that uses the existing ratings of users to calculate the hypothetical trust that might exist between them. The purpose is to demonstrate how some basic social networking when applied to an existing system can help in alleviating problems of traditional recommender system schemes. Interestingly, such schemes are also alleviating the cold start problem from which mainly new users are suffering. In order to show how good the system is in that respect, we measure the performance at various times as the system evolves and we also contrast the solution with existing approaches. Finally, we present the results which justify that such schemes undoubtedly work better than a system that makes no use of trust at all.},

In this recommender system there exist a web of trust, which is formed on the basis of trust among agents in application domain. The personalized recommendations lists for the user agent are generated by the recommender agents that consist of Intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are computed on the basis of the extent to which the products match the profile of the user.

On the basis of his experience with that item, he then updates his trust on his recommenders.

We argue that users self-defined networks of trust could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by a self-defined relationship in a social Web system, CiteuLike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share. Our study shows that users connected by a network of trust exhibit significantly higher similarity on items and meta-data than non-connected users. This similarity is highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users.},

The main idea is to suggest new relevant items for an active user based on the judgements from other members in the like-minded community. However, these CF-based methods encounter the obstacles, such as sparse data, cold-start and robustness. This paper proposes to deal with these issues by associating similarity measurement from users' rating patterns with trust metric. After investigating the large data set from Epinions.com, we find that user similarity and trust are strongly correlated. This fact also explains why using trust (instead of user similarity) could lead to very close mean prediction accuracy in a Pearson Correlation Coefficient-like recommendation algorithm. Our novel method incorporates these two factors into one unified recommendation algorithm. The experimental results indicate that a good prediction strategy can come from filtering the ratings from the users who have high trust and low similarity or vice versa. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trust-based approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative filtering methods. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {Trust and Reputation management play an important role in agent-based Recommender Systems. Although several protocols and ontologies of agents using trust and reputation has been proposed, none of them has been so extensively used and implicitly accepted by research community as those from Agent Reputation and Trust (ART in advane) testbed. The motivation of this adaptation is to facilitate the use of ART principles in real distributed applications instead of a centralized testbed for experimentation. This paper presents an adaptation of the protocols proposed by ART testbed to a codification for the most popular Agent platform: JADE. This implementation follows a coherent API with the FIPA protocols included in JADE distribution for an easy use. We also complement the behaviours of corresponding initiators and responders of the protocols with an ontology formed by a collection of concepts, predicates and agent actions that may represent as the ART application domain as any other service-oriented domain. The proposal has been designed to be applied in domains where multi-agent e-commerce solutions are needed. Future work includes the integration of this ontology and protocols in context-aware scenarios such as an airport. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Personalization and customization have been shown to be an indispensable function in today's eCommerce businesses and highly applauded by their customers. Collaborative filtering is one of the two major techniques commonly employed by today's recommender systems and has found its way into the recommendation of many diversified types of products. However, collaborative filtering technique suffers from sparsity and cold start problems. The recent emergence of Web 2.0 offers an opportunity to remedy these problems by incorporating the trust relationships explicitly expressed by the users, as evident by some recent research. Previous work in using trust for making recommendation mainly focuses on inferring trust weights for unspecified trust relations. In this paper, we model the problem of using trust for recommendation as a linear program. We then describe two heuristics that leverages trust to estimate the ratings of unseen products by a given user. Finally we develop various strategies of giving continuous trust weights by considering the contextual information pertaining to trust statements and examine their impact on recommendation accuracy using the empirical data collected from Epinion.com. The experimental results show that assigning continuous trust weights using some of the proposed strategies yields higher recommendation accuracy when compared to the baseline approach that gives Boolean trust values.

abstract = {As an indispensable technique in the field of Information Filtering, Recommender System has been well studied and developed both in academia and in industry recently. However, most of current recommender systems suffer the following problems: (1) The large-scale and sparse data of the user-item matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality. As a result, most of the recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. (2) The traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real world recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. In this framework, we coin the term Social Trust Ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.

We propose that trust is another important issue in recommender systems. Due to data sparsity of the item ratings matrix, we may not find the similar neighbors of the active user and thus CF Recommender Systems often fails in this condition. Taking trust into consideration can alleviate those problems. We consider replacing similarity weight with trust weight by trust propagation over the trust network.

abstract = {The Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia collaboratively edited by Internet users with a minimum of administration. Anybody can write an article for the Wikipedia and there is no verification of the author's expertise on the particular subject. This may lead to problems relating to the quality of articles, especially completeness and correctness of information, and inaccuracies in the Wikipedia have been rumoured to cause students to fail courses; innocent people have been associated with the killing of John F. Kennedy, etc. Providing a means to assess the correctness, completeness and impartiality of information in the Wikipedia is therefore vitally important for the users to build trust in the Wikipedia and ensure the continued success and growth of the system. Integrating a reputation system into the Wikipedia would help users assess the quality of articles and provide a powerful incentive for authors to improve the quality of their articles. There are currently more than 7.5 million articles in the Wikipedia, and more than a thousand new articles are added daily, so the investment in the existing system is significant. The introduction of a recommendation system should therefore not require any modifications to the existing Wikipedia software. In this paper we examine the problem of reengineering a large and popular system, in this case the Wikipedia, in order to include a reputation system. We propose a recommendation system, which allows Wikipedia users to calculate a personalised rating for any article based on feedback (recommendations) provided by other Wikipedia users. The recommendation system developed for the Wikipedia is based on a general architecture, which we believe applies to many existing applications for online collaboration. The proposed recommendation system is implemented in a proxy placed between the user's web-browser and the Wikipedia server, e.g., on the user's own machine, so there is no need to modify Wikipedia servers or software. A simple prototype of the proposed recommendation system is presented in this paper along with a preliminary evaluation of the prototype. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With this problem in mind, in this paper we introduce the social trust of the users into the recommender system and build the trust relation between them. The values of trust among users are adjusted by using the reinforcement learning algorithm. On the basis of this, a user trust-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is proposed. It uses the combined similarity to generate recommendation, which considers not only the similarity between user profiles but user trust as well. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithm in recommendation accuracy, especially in the face of malicious profile injection attacks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Previous trust models are mainly focused on reputational mechanism based on explicit trust ratings. However, the large amount of user-generated content and community context published on Web is often ignored. Without enough information, there are several problems with previous trust models: first, they cannot determine in which field one user trusts in another, so many models assume that trust exists in all fields. Second some models are not able to delineate the variation of trust scales, therefore they regard each user trusts all his friends to the same extent. Third, since these models only focus on explicit trust ratings, so the trust matrix is very sparse. To solve these problems, we present RCCtrust - a trust model which combines Reputation-, Content- and Context-based mechanisms to provide more accurate, fine-grained and efficient trust management for the electronic community. We extract trust-related information from user-generated content and community context from Web to extend reputation-based trust models. We introduce role-based and behavior-based reasoning functionalities to infer users' interests and category-specific trust relationships. Following the study in sociology, RCCtrust exploits similarities between pairs of users to depict differentiated trust scales. The experimental results show that RCCtrust outperforms pure user similarity method and linear decay trust-aware technique in both accuracy and coverage for a Recommender System. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer.},

Since trust is often a gradual phenomenon, fuzzy relations are the pre-eminent tools for modeling such networks. However, as current trust-enhanced RSs do not work with the notion of distrust, they cannot differentiate unknown users from malicious users, nor represent inconsistency. These are serious drawbacks in large networks where many users are unknown to each other and might provide contradictory information. In this paper, we advocate the use of a trust model in which trust scores are (trust,distrust)-couples, drawn from a bilattice that preserves valuable trust provenance information including gradual trust, distrust, ignorance, and inconsistency.

abstract = {We study protocols to enable one user (the principal) to make potentially profitable but risky interactions with another user (the agent), in the absence of direct trust between the two parties. In such situations, it is possible to enable the interaction indirectly through a chain of credit or "trust" links. We introduce a model that provides insight into many disparate applications, including open currency systems, network trust aggregation systems, and manipulation-resistant recommender systems. Each party maintains a trust account for each other party. When a principal's trust balance for an agent is high enough to cover potential losses from a bad interaction, direct trust is sufficient to enable the interaction. Allowing indirect trust opens up more interaction opportunities, but also expands the strategy space of an attacker seeking to exploit the community for its own ends. We show that with indirect trust exchange protocols, some friction is unavoidable: any protocol that satisfies a natural strategic safety property that we call sum-sybilproofness can sometimes lead to a reduction in expected overall trust balances even on interactions that are profitable in expectation. Thus, for long-term growth of trust accounts, which are assets enabling risky but valuable interactions, it may be necessary to limit the use of indirect trust. We present the hedged-transitive protocol and show that it achieves the optimal rate of expected growth in trust accounts, among all protocols satisfying the sum-sybilproofness condition.

Such attacks may lead to erosion of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. One critical area of research in security of recommender systems is the study of attack models. In this paper, we propose an approach for creating attack models. Our paper explores the importance of target item and filler items in mounting effective shilling attacks. Our attack strategies are based on intelligent selection of filler items. Filler items are selected on the basis of the target item rating distribution. We propose filler item strategies for both all-user attacks and in-segment attacks. We show through experiments that our attack strategies are the most effective attack strategies against both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

We define a family of structures that we call Affinity Networks (or even Graphs) that show self-organized interest-based clusters. Empirical evidence proves that affinity networks are small worlds and shows scale-free features. The relevance of this finding is augmented with the introduction of a proactive recommendation scheme, namely DeHinter, that exploits this natural feature. The intuition behind this scheme is that a user would trust her network of elective affinities more than anonymous and generic suggestions made by impersonal entities. The accuracy of the recommendation is evaluated by way of a 10-fold cross validation, and a prototype has been implemented for further feedbacks from the users. {\textcopyright} 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems have emerged in various applications to support item recommendation, which solve the information-overload problem by suggesting items of interests to users. Recently, trust-based recommender systems have incorporated the trustworthiness of users into the CF techniques to improve the quality of recommendation. They propose trust computation models to derive the trust value based on users' past ratings on items. A user is more trustworthy if he has contributed more accurate predictions than other users. Nevertheless, none of them derive the trust value based on a sequence of user's ratings on items. We propose a sequence-based trust model to derive the trust value based on users' sequences of ratings on documents. In knowledge-intensive environments, users normally have various information needs to access required documents over time, which forms a sequence of documents ordered according to their access time. The model considers two factors - time factor and document similarity in computing the trustworthiness of users. The proposed model is incorporated into standard collaborative filtering method to discover trustworthy neighbors for making predictions. The experiment result shows that the proposed model can improve the prediction accuracy of CF method comparing to other trust-based recommender systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {With the advent of sophisticated networking technologies and the related applications, more and more computers are getting hooked to the Internet. This is mainly for utilizing several services ranging from information sharing to electronic transactions. P2P networks which allow decentralized systems, have posed problems related to trust when transactions have to be carried out. Current literature proposes several solutions for trust management and reputation computation. The solutions base their assessment of reputations on the number of successful transactions or on the similarity of the feedbacks. There are some concerns in the feedback ratings if we are not considering the issues like number of transactions, frequency of transactions with the same peer and different peers, age of transaction, how frequently a given peer attends a common vendor, and the number of common vendors between the pairs. This paper puts forward a reputation computation system addressing these concerns. It implicitly allows detection of malicious peers. It also incorporates a corrective mechanism, if the feedbacks are from more number of malicious peers. The implementations and the results that support our claims are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering recommender systems are typically unable to generate adequate recommendations for newcomers. Empirical evidence suggests that the incorporation of a trust network among the users of a recommender system can significantly help to alleviate this problem. Hence, users are highly encouraged to connect to other users to expand the trust network, but choosing whom to connect to is often a difficult task. Given the impact this choice has on the delivered recommendations, it is critical to guide newcomers through this early stage connection process. In this paper, we identify several classes of key figures in the trust network, namely mavens, frequent raters and connectors. Furthermore, we introduce measures to assess the influence of these users on the amount and the quality of the recommendations delivered by a trust-enhanced collaborative filtering recommender system. Experiments on a dataset from Epinions.com support the claim that generated recommendations for new users are more beneficial if they connect to an identified key figure compared to a random user. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.},

More and more online users are relying on this type of services such as news, articles, bookmarks, and various user-generated contents around World Wide Web. However, the quality and the veracity of peers' contributions are not well managed. Without a practical means to assess the quality of peer production services, the consequence is information-overloading. In this study, we present a recommender system based on the trust of social networks. Through the trust computing, the quality and the veracity of peer production services can be appropriately assessed. Two prominent fuzzy logic applications - fuzzy inference system and fuzzy MCDM method are utilized to support the decision of service choice. The experimental results showed that the proposed recommender system can significantly enhance the quality of peer production services and furthermore overcome the information overload problems. In addition, a trust-based social news system is built to demonstrate the application of the proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the recent past, a considerable research has been devoted to trust and reputation mechanisms to simplify complex transactions for open environments in social networking, e-commerce, and recommender systems (RS). In real life, we come to know about others through our social circle according to their reputation which is a public view. However, it is not always adequate to depend solely on the public view and therefore a trust measure is required to give a personalized view of the future encounters with a specific partner. In this paper, we propose fuzzy computational models for both trust and reputation concepts. Reciprocity and experience are used for trust modeling while the proposed reputation model is a fuzzy extension of beta reputation model. A two-level filtering methodology is proposed to benefit to a large extent from both the concepts separately. In order to justify the proposed models, we compared them with the existing reputation models for movie RS. The experimental results show that the incorporation of trust and reputation concepts into RS indeed improves the recommendation accuracy and establish that our models are better than beta and the popular eBay reputation models. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The primary premise upon which top-N recommender systems operate is that similar users are likely to have similar tastes with regard to their product choices. For this reason, recommender algorithms depend deeply on similarity metrics to build the recommendation lists for end-users. However, it has been noted that the products offered on recommendation lists are often too similar to each other and attention has been paid towards the goal of improving diversity to avoid monotonous recommendations. Noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we model the competing goals of maximizing the diversity of the retrieved list while maintaining adequate similarity to the user query as a binary optimization problem. We explore a solution strategy to this optimization problem by relaxing it to a trust-region problem. This leads to a parameterized eigenvalue problem whose solution is finally quantized to the required binary solution. We apply this approach to the top-N prediction problem, evaluate the system performance on the Movielens dataset and compare it with a standard item-based top-N algorithm. A new evaluation metric ItemNovelty is proposed in this work. Improvements on both diversity and accuracy are obtained compared to the benchmark algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {Recommender systems support internet users in finding and identifying products and services suiting their individual demands (e.g.: digital cameras, financial services). Although recommender systems already offer mechanisms which alleviate the comparison of different suitable products (e.g. product lists, comparison pages) users usually have difficulties in decision making and finding the optimal option. Persuasive mechanisms can be used in such situations for underlining product differences and reinforcing confidence in the users'own decision. This leads to an increase of the trust level and supports the decision making process. Especially theories concerning user behaviour in buying situations constitute great potential for persuasion in recommender systems. It has been shown that the user's perception of the value of a certain product is highly influenced by the context (i.e. the set of presented products in the choice set). Well-known context effects are the asymmetric dominance effect, the attraction effect, or the compromise effect. This paper presents a multi-preferential and multi-alternative model (i.e. more than two product attributes and more than two products are supported) for calculating dominance values of items in choice sets and thus offers the possibility of determining the best recommendation set in a given choice situation. The performance of the model is shown by the application on empirical data (choice sets) gained by a previously conducted user study.},

Social Trust models like Recommender system, Trust management for pervasive computing, are becoming invaluable part of distributed systems. In this paper we have proposed a multi-agent based collaborative decision making framework for distributed environment in which a group of agents collaborate for decision making based on social issues. The proposed framework is capable of making good decision based on social parameters. Geographical Information System (GIS) is a well suited example for Multi Agent System (MAS) and GIS application is considered for our experimental work. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N = 60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the study's results.},

In addition, the authors also discuss the core of this model-an algorithm to compute profile similarity in a community.

Empirical evidence suggests that the incorporation of a trust network among the users of the RS can leverage such 'cold start' (CS) recommendations. Hence, new users should be encouraged to connect to the network as soon as possible. But whom should new users connect to? Given the impact this choice has on the delivered recommendations, it is critical to guide newcomers through this early stage connection process. In this paper, we identify key figures in the trust network (in particular mavens, connectors and frequent raters) and investigate their influence on the coverage and accuracy of a collaborative filtering RS. Using a dataset from Epinions.com, we demonstrate that the generated recommendations for new user are more beneficial if they connect to an identified key figure compared to a random user.

abstract = {Recommender systems are gaining widespread acceptance in e-commerce applications to confront the "information overload"problem. Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommender system. Some recommender systems (Amazon.com, etc.) try to explain their recommendations, in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. However, their explanations are not sufficient, because they are based solely on rating or navigational data, ignoring the content data. Several systems have proposed the combination of content data with rating data to provide more accurate recommendations, but they cannot provide qualitative justifications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that attains both accurate and justifiable recommendations. We construct a feature profile for the users to reveal their favorite features. Moreover, we group users into biclusters (i.e., groups of users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matching between the preferences of the target user and each group of users. We have evaluated the quality of our justifications with an objective metric in two real data sets (Reuters and MovieLens), showing the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {We propose a trust model for recommender systems in mobile virtual communities that improves the quality of recommendations. High-quality recommendations come from trustworthy recommenders and are supported by convincing (from a user's viewpoint) arguments. Such recommendations match better a user's profile and his/her way of reasoning. We also propose a mobile open multi-agent framework for our model of trust. In this framework each member is represented by an embedded agent, which resides in the user's mobile, and by a delegate agent, which runs in a meeting infrastructure (called Virtual Agora) where it interacts with other delegates. Each delegate builds and maintains two weighted and subjective networks of trust: a register of recommenders of proven (un)trustworthiness and a register of rated items. In our setting, delegates generally prefer opinions that come from their network of recommenders; moreover delegates are able to play argumentation games. The implemented system is also privacy preserving. Agents receive different ratings depending on their trustworthy recommenders and these ratings are not necessarily public. Since we address mobile communities of users, the Virtual Agora is designed to reduce communication traffic between agents. Finally, we illustrate these concepts in a recommender system for restaurants. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Like-mindedness, or similarity-based recommendation, is the cause of a variety of problems that plague recommender systems. An alternative view of the problem, based on trust, offers the potential to address many of the previous limiations in CF. In this work we present a varation of kNN, the trusted k-nearest recommenders (or kNR) algorithm, which allows users to learn who and how much to trust one another by evaluating the utility of the rating information they receive. This method redefines the way CF is performed, and while avoiding some of the pitfalls that similarity-based CF is prone to, outperforms the basic similarity-based methods in terms of prediction accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Federation for Information Processing.},

In literature, the recommender systems use databases to generate recommendations. The presented design uses ontologies, a knowledge representation technique for creating annotated content for Semantic Web. Seeing the potential and popularity of ontologies among researchers, we believe that ontologies will be build and maintained in numerous knowledge domains for the Semantic Web and future applications. The presented recommender system uses temporal ontologies that absorb the effect of changes in the ontologies due to the dynamic nature of domains, in addition to the benefits of ontologies. A case study of tourism recommender system is chosen to generate the recommendations for the selection of destination, travel agents and the flight schedule.

In such scenarios, the query processor begins to acquire the role of a recommender system.

This broadened view of query processing poses several technical challenges. We propose a decision theoretic model for ranking answers in the in the order of their expected relevance to the user. This model combines a relevance function that reflects the relevance a user would associate with answer tuples and a density function which reflects the each tuple's distribution of missing data. Adoption of this model foregrounds three general challenges: (i) how to assess the relevance and density functions automatically (ii) how to support e±cient query processing to re- trieve relevant tuples and (iii) how to make users trust the recom- mended answers.

In particular, assessing the credibility of news is a major research challenge. Typically, criteria such as freshness, relevance and viewer profile have been used by news services to rank news. However, these services do not deal with credibility from a qualitative perspective, and do not provide mechanisms to cope with controversial news reports. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework that brings the notions of trust and pluralism into play. In our proposal, we integrate dialectical reasoning into a news recommender system.

This paper presents a novel scheme, called BuddyCast, that builds such a social network for a user by exchanging user interest profiles using exploitation and exploration principles. Additionally, we show how the interest of a user in TV programs can be predicted from the zapping behavior by the introduced user-item relevance models, thereby avoiding the explicit rating of TV programs. Further, we present how the social network of a user can be used to realize a truly distributed recommendation of TV programs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel user interface for the personalized peer-to-peer television system that encompasses a personalized tag-based navigation to browse the available distributed content. The user interface also visualizes the social network of a user, thereby increasing community feeling which increases trust amongst users and within available content and creates incentives of to exchange content within the community. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Recommender Systems (RS), designed to alleviate this problem, have so far not been very successful, and recent research suggests that this is due to the lack of the social context and inter-personal trust. We simulated an online film RS with 60 participants, where recommender information was added to the recommendations, and a subset of these were attributed to friends of the participants. Participants overwhelmingly preferred recommendations from familiar recommenders with whom they shared interests and a high rating overlap. When recommenders were familiar, rating overlap was the most important decision factor, whereas when they were unfamiliar, the combination of profile similarity and rating overlap was important. We recommend that RS and social networking functionality should be integrated, and show how RS functionality can be added to an existing social networking system by visualising profile similarity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Philip Bonhard, M.

In addition to traditional popular collaborative filtering recommender technology, recent research has shown that incorporating trust and reputation models into the recommendation process can have a positive impact on the accuracy and robustness of recommendations. Previous work related to trust in recommender systems has focused on profile-level trust model. In this paper we argue that items belonging to different topics need different trustworthy users to make recommendation, so topic-level trust will be more effective than profile-level trust in incorporating into the recommendation process. Based on this idea, we design a topic-level trust model which helps a user to quantify the trustworthy degree on a specific topic, and propose a new recommender algorithm by incorporating the new model into the mechanics of a standard collaborative filtering recommender system. The results from experiments based on Movielens dataset show that the new method can improve the recommendation accuracy of recommender systems. collaborative filtering, profile similarity, recommender systems, topic-level trust.},

Attackers, who cannot be readily distinguished from ordinary users, may inject biased profiles in an attempt to force a system to adapt in a manner advantageous to them. Such attacks may lead to a degradation of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. Recent research has begun to examine the vulnerabilities and robustness of different collaborative recommendation techniques in the face of profile injection attacks. In this article, we outline some of the major issues in building secure recommender systems, concentrating in particular on the modeling of attacks and their impact on various recommendation algorithms. We introduce several new attack models and perform extensive simulation-based evaluations to show which attacks are most successful and practical against common recommendation techniques. Our study shows that both user-based and item-based algorithms are highly vulnerable to specific attack models, but that hybrid algorithms may provide a higher degree of robustness. Using our formal characterization of attack models, we also introduce a novel classification-based approach for detecting attack profiles and evaluate its effectiveness in neutralizing attacks. {\textcopyright} 2007 ACM.},

This observation led us to build a trust model for recommender agents with a focus on the agent's trustworthiness as derived from the user's perception of its competence and especially its ability to explain the recommended results. We present in this article new results of our work in developing design principles and algorithms for constructing explanation interfaces. We show the effectiveness of these principles via a significant-scale user study in which we compared an interface developed based on these principles with a traditional one. The new interface, called the organization interface where results are grouped according to their tradeoff properties, is shown to be significantly more effective in building user trust than the traditional approach. Users perceive it more capable and efficient in assisting them to make decisions, and they are more likely to return to the interface. We therefore recommend designers to build trust-inspiring interfaces due to their high likelihood to increase users' intention to save cognitive effort and the intention to return to the recommender system. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
